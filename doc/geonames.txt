= GeoNames.net / GeoNames.org =

We use a commercial account for GeoNames web services, to do reverse
time zone lookups. The account details were setup by Mark Shuttleworth, and
are:

   username:  launchpad
   password:  7Sn2d%sQ

The contact person is Marc Wick <marc@geonames.org> if there are any
questions or problems. We can basically use the hostname ba-ws.geonames.net
(note the .net and not the .org) and we pre-pend username=launchpad before
the other parameters. On the account page, we can specify which hosts can be
referrers. This is initially configured as "launchpad." which should cover
launchpad.net and launchpad.dev
