= This is a FAQ =

Even though similar questions are shown when a user creates a new
question, common questions still happen for a number of reasons.
The Answer Tracker can be used to manage common answers
(a.k.a. Frequently Asked Question - FAQ) which can be used to answer
a particular question.


== Linking to a FAQ ==

Any logged in user can use the 'This is a FAQ' action item to link
the question to an existing FAQ.

For example, No Privileges Person comes across a question about SVG
support in Firefox. That question has a well-known answer, so he clicks
on 'This is a FAQ' to answer the question:

    # We use backslashreplace because the page title includes smart quotes.
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.helpers import backslashreplace
    >>> user_browser.open(
    ...     'http://answers.launchpad.dev/firefox/+question/2')
    >>> print backslashreplace(user_browser.title)
    Mozilla Firefox question #2:
    \u201cProblem showing the SVG demo on W3C site\u201d

    >>> user_browser.getLink('This is a FAQ').click()
    >>> print backslashreplace(user_browser.title)
    Is question #2 a FAQ?

This page lists the existing FAQs matching the question's title. In
that listing, the radio labels only contain the FAQ id. The FAQ title is
displayed in a link besides the label. The default selected FAQ is the
one currently associated to the question. In this particular case, since
no FAQ is associated to the question, the 'No existing FAQs are
relevant' option is selected.

    >>> def printFAQOptions(contents):
    ...     buttons =  find_main_content(user_browser.contents).findAll(
    ...         'input', {'name': 'field.faq'})
    ...     for button in buttons:
    ...         label = extract_text(button.parent)
    ...         if button.get('checked', None):
    ...             radio = '(*)'
    ...         else:
    ...             radio = '( )'
    ...         if button['value']:
    ...             link = button.findNext('a').renderContents()
    ...         else:
    ...             link = ''
    ...         print radio, label, link
    >>> printFAQOptions(user_browser.contents)
    (*) No existing FAQs are relevant
    ( ) 9: How do I troubleshoot problems with extensions/themes?
    ( ) 7: How do I install Java?

    >>> print user_browser.getLink('How do I troubleshoot problems').url
    http://answers.launchpad.dev/firefox/+faq/9

The query used to find these results is displayed in the search field
under the radio widgets. That query defaults to the question's title.

    >>> search_field = user_browser.getControl(name='field.faq-query')
    >>> print search_field.value
    Problem showing the SVG demo on W3C site

From the titles, it doesn't seem like one of these FAQs would be
appropriate. The user can modify the search query and hit the 'Search'
button to update the list of available choices:

    >>> search_field.value = 'Where can I find a SVG plugin'
    >>> user_browser.getControl('Search').click()

The page is updated with a new list of FAQs:

    >>> print user_browser.title
    Is question #2 a FAQ?
    >>> printFAQOptions(user_browser.contents)
    (*) No existing FAQs are relevant
    ( ) 10: How do I install plugins (Shockwave, QuickTime, etc.)?
    ( ) 7: How do I install Java?
    ( ) 8: How do I install Extensions?

The most relevant result seems like the good answer, so the user selects
it.

    >>> user_browser.getControl('10').selected = True

There is a 'Message' field that will be used to answer the question.
It is pre-filled, but he can change its value. The FAQ reference will
be appended to the message.

    >>> print user_browser.getControl('Message').value
    No Privileges Person suggests this article as an answer to your question:

He can then click 'Link FAQ' to answer the question with the selected
FAQ. After clicking the button, the user is redirected to the question
page.

    >>> user_browser.getControl('Link FAQ').click()
    >>> print user_browser.url
    http://answers.launchpad.dev/firefox/+question/2

He sees that the question's status was changed to 'Answered':

    >>> details_portlet = find_portlet(
    ...     user_browser.contents, 'Mozilla Firefox question #2')
    >>> print details_portlet.find('b', text='Status:').next.strip()
    Answered

A link to the FAQ appears under the question's description:

    >>> print extract_text(
    ...     find_tag_by_id(user_browser.contents, 'related-faq'))
    Related FAQ: How do I install plugins (Shockwave, QuickTime, etc.)?
    >>> print user_browser.getLink('How do I install plugins').url
    http://answers.launchpad.dev/firefox/+faq/10

The answer message was added to the question's discussion:

    >>> print extract_text(find_tags_by_class(
    ...     user_browser.contents, 'boardCommentBody')[-1]).encode(
    ...     'ascii', 'backslashreplace')
    No Privileges Person suggests this article as an answer to your question:
    FAQ #10: \u201cHow do I install plugins...


== Modifying the FAQ ==

The link to the FAQ can be changed by using the same 'This is a FAQ'
option. Continuing on the previous example, the user went on to read
the FAQ that he just linked and found that it doesn't really answer
the question. To correct the mistake, he uses the same 'This is a FAQ'
action.

    >>> user_browser.getLink('This is a FAQ').click()

The existing linked FAQ is selected and the other FAQs matching the
question's title are displayed:

    >>> printFAQOptions(user_browser.contents)
    ( ) No existing FAQs are relevant
    (*) 10: How do I install plugins (Shockwave, QuickTime, etc.)?
    ( ) 9: How do I troubleshoot problems with extensions/themes?
    ( ) 7: How do I install Java?

He changes the message and click 'Link FAQ'.

    >>> user_browser.getControl('Message').value = (
    ...     "Sorry, this document doesn't really answer your question.")
    >>> user_browser.getControl('Link FAQ').click()

But since, he forgot to change the link, the form is displayed again
with an error message.

    >>> print user_browser.url
    http://answers.launchpad.dev/firefox/+question/2/+linkfaq
    >>> for message in get_feedback_messages(user_browser):
    ...     print message
    There is 1 error.
    You didn't modify the linked FAQ.

To remove the FAQ, the user selects the 'No existing...' option and 
submit the form again.

    >>> user_browser.getControl('No existing FAQs').selected = True
    >>> user_browser.getControl('Link FAQ').click()

The new message was added to the question:

    >>> print extract_text(find_tags_by_class(
    ...     user_browser.contents, 'boardCommentBody')[-1]).encode(
    ...     'ascii', 'backslashreplace')
    Sorry, this document doesn't really answer your question.

The link was also removed from the details portlet:

    >>> print find_tag_by_id(user_browser.contents, 'related-faq')
    None


== Creating a new FAQ ==

When no existing FAQs are relevant, it is possible to create a new FAQ
from the same 'This is a FAQ' action. But this option is reserved to
users having 'moderation' privilege on the project (this includes
answer contacts and the project's owner).

Since No Privileges Person isn't an answer contact for the project nor
the project owner, he doesn't have the possibility to create a new FAQ.

    >>> user_browser.getLink('This is a FAQ').click()
    >>> user_browser.getLink('create a new FAQ')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    LinkNotFoundError

    >>> user_browser.open(
    ...     'http://answers.launchpad.dev/firefox/+question/2/+createfaq')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    Unauthorized: ...

Sample Person who is the project owner does have that ability.

    >>> owner_browser = setupBrowser(auth='Basic test@canonical.com:test')
    >>> owner_browser.open(
    ...     'http://answers.launchpad.dev/firefox/+question/2')
    >>> owner_browser.getLink('This is a FAQ').click()
    >>> owner_browser.getLink('create a new FAQ').click()
    >>> print owner_browser.url
    http://answers.launchpad.dev/firefox/+question/2/+createfaq
    >>> print owner_browser.title
    Create a FAQ for Mozilla Firefox

The FAQ title and content are pre-filled with the target question. He
edits them to be more appropriate:

    >>> print owner_browser.getControl('Title').value
    Problem showing the SVG demo on W3C site
    >>> owner_browser.getControl('Title').value = 'Displaying SVG in Firefox'

    >>> print owner_browser.getControl('Content').value
    Hi! I'm trying to learn about SVG but I can't get it to work at all in
    firefox. Maybe there is a plugin? Help! Thanks.
    
    >>> owner_browser.getControl('Content').value = (
    ...     'Upgrade your browser to Firefox 2.0.')

He can also enter keywords describing the FAQ:

    >>> owner_browser.getControl('Keywords').value = (
    ...     'scalable vector graphic')

There is a 'Message' field that will be used to answer the question.
It is pre-filled, but he can change its value:

    >>> print owner_browser.getControl('Message').value
    Sample Person suggests this article as an answer to your question:
    >>> owner_browser.getControl('Message').value = 'Read the Fine Answer:'

After clicking the 'Create' button, the FAQ is created and the user is
returned to the question page.

    >>> owner_browser.getControl('Create and Link').click()
    >>> print owner_browser.url
    http://answers.launchpad.dev/firefox/+question/2

The answer message was added to the question's discussion:

    >>> print extract_text(find_tags_by_class(
    ...     owner_browser.contents, 'boardCommentBody')[-1]).encode(
    ...     'ascii', 'backslashreplace')
    Read the Fine Answer:
    FAQ...: \u201cDisplaying SVG in Firefox\u201d.

And the link to the created FAQ is displayed under the question's
description:

    >>> print extract_text(
    ...     find_tag_by_id(owner_browser.contents, 'related-faq'))
    Related FAQ: Displaying SVG in Firefox


== Viewing a FAQ ==

From a question page which has a related FAQ, the user can click on the
FAQ title to display the FAQ content.

    >>> owner_browser.getLink('Displaying SVG in Firefox').click()
    >>> print owner_browser.url
    http://answers.launchpad.dev/firefox/+faq/...
    >>> print backslashreplace(owner_browser.title)
    Mozilla Firefox FAQ #...: \u201cDisplaying SVG in Firefox\u201d

The FAQ's title appears as the prime heading:

    >>> main_content = find_main_content(owner_browser.contents)
    >>> print main_content.find('h1').renderContents()
    Displaying SVG in Firefox

The FAQ keywords and content appears just below:

    >>> print extract_text(find_tag_by_id(
    ...     owner_browser.contents, 'faq-keywords'))
    Keywords: scalable vector graphic

    >>> print extract_text(find_tag_by_id(
    ...     owner_browser.contents, 'faq-content'))
    Upgrade your browser to Firefox 2.0.

The FAQ's original author and creation date appears in the the
'Lifecycle' portlet:

    >>> print extract_text(find_portlet(owner_browser.contents, 'Lifecycle'))
    Lifecycle
    Created by: Sample Person
    When: ...

A 'Related questions' portlet contains links to the question answered by
the FAQ:

    >>> print extract_text(find_portlet(
    ...     owner_browser.contents, 'Related questions'))
    Related questions
    #2 Problem showing the SVG demo on W3C site

    >>> print owner_browser.getLink(
    ...     'Problem showing the SVG demo on W3C site').url
    http://answers.launchpad.dev/firefox/+question/2


== Distribution and Source Packages ==

Questions asked about a distribution or distribution source package
can also be linked to FAQs.

    >>> user_browser.open(
    ...     'http://answers.launchpad.dev/ubuntu/+question/11')
    >>> user_browser.title
    'Ubuntu question #11:...'
    >>> user_browser.getLink('This is a FAQ').click()
    >>> print user_browser.title
    Is question #11 a FAQ?

    >>> user_browser.open(
    ...     'http://answers.launchpad.dev/ubuntu/+source/mozilla-firefox'
    ...     '/+question/8')
    >>> user_browser.title
    'mozilla-firefox in ubuntu question #8:...'
    >>> user_browser.getLink('This is a FAQ').click()
    >>> print user_browser.title
    Is question #8 a FAQ?


== Solved questions cannot be linked to a FAQ ==

Since linking a question to a FAQ is like giving an answer, it cannot
be used on solved questions:

    >>> user_browser.open(
    ...     'http://answers.launchpad.dev/ubuntu/+source/mozilla-firefox/'
    ...     '+question/9')
    >>> details_portlet = find_portlet(
    ...     user_browser.contents, 'mozilla-firefox in ubuntu question #9')
    >>> print details_portlet.find('b', text='Status:').next.strip()
    Solved
    >>> user_browser.getLink('This is a FAQ')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    LinkNotFoundError
