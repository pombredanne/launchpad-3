= Question Workflow =

The status of a question changes based on the action done by users on
it. To demonstrate the workflow, we will use the existing question #2 on
the Firefox product which was filed by 'Sample Person'.

    # We will use one browser objects for the owner, and one for the user
    # providing support, 'No Privileges Person' here.
    >>> from zope.testbrowser.testing import Browser
    >>> owner_browser = Browser()
    >>> owner_browser.handleErrors = False
    >>> owner_browser.addHeader(
    ...     "Authorization", 'Basic test@canonical.com:test')

    >>> support_browser = Browser()
    >>> support_browser.handleErrors = False
    >>> support_browser.addHeader(
    ...     'Authorization', 'Basic no-priv@canonical.com:test')

    # Define some utility functions to retrieve easily the last comment
    # added and the status of the question.
    >>> from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup
    >>> def find_request_status(contents):
    ...     soup = BeautifulSoup(contents)
    ...     return soup.find('b', text='Status:').next.strip()
    ...
    >>> def  find_last_comment(contents):
    ...     soup = BeautifulSoup(contents)
    ...     return soup.fetch('div', 'boardCommentBody')[-1]

== Logging In ==

To participate in a question, the user must be logged in.

    >>> anon_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/firefox/+question/2')
    >>> print anon_browser.contents
    <!DOCTYPE...
    ...
    To post a message you must <a href="+login">log in</a>.
    ...


== Requesting for More Information ==

It's not unusual that the original message of a question is terse
and quite vague. In these cases, to help the user, some more
information will be required.

No Privileges Person visits the question. He see the heading
'Can you help with this problem?'. The problem is not clear, he
needs more information. To request for more information from the
question owner, No Privileges Person enters his question in the 
'Message' field and clicks on the 'Add Information Request' button.

    >>> support_browser.open(
    ...     'http://launchpad.dev/firefox/+question/2')
    >>> content = find_tag_by_id(
    ...     support_browser.contents, 'can-you-help-with-this-problem')
    >>> print content.h2.renderContents()
    Can you help with this problem?
    
    >>> support_browser.getControl('Message').value = (
    ...     "Can you provide an example of an URL displaying the problem?")
    >>> support_browser.getControl('Add Information Request').click()

The message was added to the question and its status was changed to
'Needs information':

    >>> print find_request_status(support_browser.contents)
    Needs information
    >>> print find_last_comment(
    ...     support_browser.contents).renderContents()
    <p>Can you provide an example of an URL displaying the problem?</p>

Of course, if you don't add a message, clicking on the button will give
you an error.

    >>> support_browser.getControl('Add Information Request').click()
    >>> soup = BeautifulSoup(support_browser.contents)
    >>> print soup.first('div', 'message').renderContents()
    Please enter a message.


== Answering with More Information ==

When the question is in the 'Needs information' state, it means that
the question owner should come back and provide more information. He
can do so by entering the reply in the 'Message' box and clicking on
the "I'm Providing More Information" button. Note that the question
owner cannot see the 'Can you help with this problem?' heading because
it is not relevant to his tasks.

    >>> owner_browser.open(
    ...     'http://launchpad.dev/firefox/+question/2')
    >>> content = find_tag_by_id(
    ...     owner_browser.contents, 'can-you-help-with-this-problem')
    >>> content is None
    True

    >>> owner_browser.getControl('Message').value = (
    ...     "The following SVG doesn't display properly:\n"
    ...     "http://www.w3.org/2001/08/rdfweb/rdfweb-chaals-and-dan.svg")
    >>> owner_browser.getControl("I'm Providing More Information").click()

Once the owner replied with the, hopefully, requested information, the
status is changed to Open and his answer appended to the question
discussion.

    >>> print find_request_status(owner_browser.contents)
    Open
    >>> print find_last_comment(owner_browser.contents).renderContents()
    <p>The following SVG doesn't display properly:<br />
    <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.w3.org/2001/08/rdfweb/rdfweb-chaals-and-dan.svg">...</a></p>


== Giving an Answer ==

Once the question is clarified, it is easier for a user to give an
answer. This is done by entering the answer in the 'Message' box
and clicking the 'Add Answer' button.

    >>> support_browser.open(
    ...     'http://launchpad.dev/firefox/+question/2')
    >>> support_browser.getControl('Message').value = (
    ...     "New version of the firefox package are available with SVG "
    ...     "support enabled. You can use apt-get or adept to upgrade.")
    >>> support_browser.getControl('Add Answer').click()

This moves the the question to the Answered state and adds the
answer to the end of the discussion:

    >>> print find_request_status(support_browser.contents)
    Answered
    >>> print find_last_comment(
    ...     support_browser.contents).renderContents()
    <p>New version of the firefox package are available with SVG support
    enabled. You can use apt-get or adept to upgrade.</p>


== Confirming an Answer ==

When the owner comes back on the question page, he will now see a new
'This Solved My Problem' button near the answer.

    >>> owner_browser.open(
    ...     'http://launchpad.dev/firefox/+question/2')
    >>> soup = BeautifulSoup(owner_browser.contents)
    >>> soup.fetch('div', 'boardComment')[-1].first('input', type='submit')
    <input type="submit" name="field.actions.confirm"
     value="This Solved My Problem" />

(Note although we have three comments on the question, that's the only
one that has this button. Only answers have this button.)

There is also a hint below the form to the question owner about using
the 'This Solved My Problem' button.

    >>> answer_button_paragraph = find_tag_by_id(
    ...     owner_browser.contents, 'answer-button-hint')
    >>> print extract_text(answer_button_paragraph)
    To confirm an answer, use the 'This Solved My Problem' button located at
    the bottom of the answer.

Clicking that button will confirm that the answer solved the problem.

    >>> owner_browser.getControl('This Solved My Problem').click()

This changes the status of the question to 'Solved' and mark
'No Privileges Person' as the solver.

    >>> print find_request_status(owner_browser.contents)
    Solved
    >>> soup = BeautifulSoup(owner_browser.contents)
    >>> np = 'No Privileges Person'
    >>> np in extract_text(soup.first('b', text='Solved by:').findNext('a'))
    True

Since no message can be provided when that button is clicked. A default
confirmation message was appended to the question discussion:

    >>> print find_last_comment(owner_browser.contents).renderContents()
    <p>Thanks No Privileges Person, that solved my question.</p>

The confirmed answer is also highlighted.

    >>> bestAnswer = soup.fetch('div', 'boardComment')[-2]
    >>> print bestAnswer.first('img')
    <img src="/@@/favourite-yes" ... title="Marked as best answer" />
    >>> print soup.first(
    ...     'div', 'boardCommentBody highlighted').renderContents()
    <p>New version of the firefox package are available with SVG support
    enabled. You can use apt-get or adept to upgrade.</p>


== Adding a Comment ==

When the question is Solved, it is still possible to add comments to it.
The user simply enters the comment in the 'Message' box and clicks the
'Add Comment' button.

    >>> owner_browser.getControl('Message').value = (
    ...     "The example now displays correctly. Thanks.")
    >>> owner_browser.getControl('Add Comment').click()

This appends the comment to the question and it doesn't change its
status:

    >>> print find_request_status(owner_browser.contents)
    Solved
    >>> print find_last_comment(owner_browser.contents).renderContents()
    <p>The example now displays correctly. Thanks.</p>


== Reopening ==

It can happen that, altough the owner confirmed the question was
solved, the original problem reappears. In this case, he can reopen
the question by entering a new message and clicking the
"I Still Need an Answer" button.

    >>> owner_browser.getControl('Message').value = (
    ...     "Actually, there are still SVGs that do not display correctly. "
    ...     "For example, the following\n"
    ...     "http://people.w3.org/maxf/ChessGML/immortal.svg doesn't display "
    ...     "correctly.")
    >>> owner_browser.getControl("I Still Need an Answer").click()

This appends the new information to the question discussion and changes
its status back to 'Open'.

    >>> print find_request_status(owner_browser.contents)
    Open
    >>> print find_last_comment(owner_browser.contents).renderContents()
    <p>Actually, there are still SVGs that do not display correctly.
    For example, the following<br />
    <a rel="nofollow" href="http://people.w3.org/maxf/ChessGML/immortal.svg">...</a> doesn't
    display correctly.</p>

This also removes the highlighting from the previous answer and sets
the answerer back to None.

    >>> soup = BeautifulSoup(owner_browser.contents)
    >>> soup.first('b', text='Solved by:') is None
    True
    >>> bestAnswer = soup.fetch('div', 'boardComment')[-4]
    >>> bestAnswer.first('strong') is None
    True
    >>> bestAnswer.first('div', 'boardCommentBody')
    <div class="boardCommentBody"><p>New version of the firefox package
    are available with SVG support enabled. You can use apt-get or adept to
    upgrade.</p></div>

In addition, this creates a reopening record that is displayed in the
reopening portlet.

    >>> portlet = find_portlet(
    ...     owner_browser.contents, 'This question was reopened')
    >>> 'Sample Person' in extract_text(portlet.fetch('a')[-1])
    True


== Self-Answer ==

The owner can also gives the solution to his own question. He simply
has to enter his solution in the 'Message' box and click the
'Problem Solved' button.

    >>> owner_browser.getControl('Message').value = (
    ...     "OK, this example requires some SVG features that will only be "
    ...     "available in Firefox 2.0.")
    >>> owner_browser.getControl("Problem Solved").click()

This appends the message to the question and sets its status to
'Solved', and the answerer as the owner. We do not however mark a 
message as the "Best answer".

    >>> print find_request_status(owner_browser.contents)
    Solved
    >>> soup = BeautifulSoup(owner_browser.contents)
    >>> print extract_text(soup.first('b', text='Solved by:').findNext('a'))
    Sample Person
    >>> bestAnswer = soup.first('img', {'title': 'Marked as best answer'})
    >>> None == bestAnswer
    True

A message is displayed to the user confirming that the question is
solved and suggesting that the user choose an answer that helped
the question owner to solve the his problem.

    >>> for message in soup.findAll('div', 'informational message'):
    ...     print extract_text(message)
    Your question is solved. If a particular message helped you solve the 
    problem, use the 'This solved my problem' button.

If the user chooses a best answer, the author of that answer
is attributed as the answerer.

    >>> owner_browser.getControl('This Solved My Problem').click()
    >>> print find_request_status(owner_browser.contents)
    Solved
    >>> soup = BeautifulSoup(owner_browser.contents)
    >>> print extract_text(soup.first('b', text='Solved by:').findNext('a'))
    No Privileges Person

The answer's message is also highlighted as the best answer.

    >>> bestAnswer = soup.find('img', {'title' : 'Marked as best answer'})
    >>> print bestAnswer
    <img src="/@@/favourite-yes" ... title="Marked as best answer" />
    >>> answerer = bestAnswer.parent.find('a')
    >>> print extract_text(answerer)
    No Privileges Person
    >>> message = bestAnswer.parent.parent.find(
    ...     'div', 'boardCommentBody highlighted')
    >>> print extract_text(message)
    New version of the firefox package are available with SVG support
    enabled. You can use apt-get or adept to upgrade.
    

= History =

The history of the question is available on the 'History' page.

    >>> anon_browser.open(
    ...     'http://launchpad.dev/firefox/+question/2')
    >>> anon_browser.getLink('History').click()
    >>> print anon_browser.title
    History of question #2

It lists all the actions performed through workflow on the question:

    >>> soup = BeautifulSoup(anon_browser.contents)
    >>> action_listing = soup.first('table', 'listing')
    >>> for header in action_listing.fetch('th'):
    ...     print header.renderContents()
    When

    >>> for row in action_listing.first('tbody').fetch('tr'):

    ...     who = extract_text(cells[1].first('a'))
    ...     action = cells[2].renderContents()
    ...     new_status = cells[3].renderContents()
    ...     print who.lstrip('&nbsp;'), action, new_status

    Sample Person        Confirm                      Solved


== Solving a question without an answer ==

The user that asks a questions may solve the question before another
user can submit an answer. Without any answer messages, the user does
not see a notification to choose a 'This solved my problem' button.

Carlos has an open question that no one has submitted an answer for.
He is able to solve the problem on his own, and submits the solution
for other users with similar problems. He does not see a notice about
choosing an answer that helped him solve his problem. 

    >>> carlos_browser = Browser()
    >>> carlos_browser.handleErrors = False
    >>> carlos_browser.addHeader(
    ...     'Authorization', 'Basic carlos@canonical.com:test')
    >>> carlos_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/firefox/+question/12')
    >>> print find_request_status(carlos_browser.contents)
    Open

    >>> answer_button_paragraph = find_tag_by_id(
    ...     carlos_browser.contents, 'answer-button-hint')
    >>> answer_button_paragraph is None
    True
    
    >>> carlos_browser.getControl('Message').value = (
    ...     "There is a bug in that version. SMP is fine after upgrading.")
    >>> carlos_browser.getControl("Problem Solved").click()
    >>> print find_request_status(carlos_browser.contents)
    Solved

    >>> content = find_main_content(carlos_browser.contents)
    >>> messages = content.findAll('div', 'informational message')
    >>> messages
    []


== Asking a separate question ==

A user that is new to Answers is not familiar with the workflow. He
may have a problem of his own, and has discovered an existing
question. We want him to ask his own question instead of intruding
into the workflow of existing questions.

No Privileges Person (a different user from the one above) discovers
the Firefox question. The solution does not work, but he thinks he has
a similar problem so he asks his own question.

    >>> user_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/firefox/+question/2')
 
    >>> content = find_main_content(user_browser.contents)
    >>> print content.find(id='can-you-help-with-this-problem')
    None
 
    >>> print content.find(id='ask-your-own-question').h2.renderContents()
    Got a question of your own?
    
    >>> user_browser.getLink('ask your own question separately').click()
    >>> print user_browser.title
    Ask a question about Mozilla Firefox

The 'Got a question of your own?' section in not relevant to the 
question owner, so Sample person does not see it.

    >>> owner_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/firefox/+question/2')
    >>> content = find_tag_by_id(
    ...     owner_browser.contents, 'ask-your-own-question')
    >>> content is None
    True
