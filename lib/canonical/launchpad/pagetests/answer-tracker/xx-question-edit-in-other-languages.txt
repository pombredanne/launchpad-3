= Editing a Question Posted in a non-English Language =

Register a new answer contact to change the list of supported languages.

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests import login, logout
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import (
    ...     IDistributionSet, IPersonSet)
    >>> from canonical.database.sqlbase import flush_database_updates
    >>> login('salgado@ubuntu.com')
    >>> ubuntu = getUtility(IDistributionSet).getByName('ubuntu')
    >>> salgado = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByEmail('salgado@ubuntu.com')
    >>> ubuntu.addAnswerContact(salgado)
    True
    >>> flush_database_updates()
    >>> logout()

A user can change the language a question was written, either because
the language was wrongly set, or because he decided to rewrite the
question in a language he speaks better.

The language can be changed on the regular 'Edit Question' screen.

    >>> browser.addHeader('Authorization', 'Basic daf@canonical.com:daf')
    >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/ubuntu/+question/5')
    >>> browser.getLink('Edit question').click()
    >>> print browser.url
    http://answers.launchpad.dev/ubuntu/+question/5/+edit

That screen contains a selection field to allow changing the question
language. The list of available languages is determined by the user's
preferred language. There is a link to allow changing this list:

    >>> browser.getLink('Change your preferred languages').click()
    >>> print browser.title
    Dafydd Harries's preferred languages

If he choose a language that is not spoken by any of the registered
answer contacts, a warning is displayed:

    # We should use goBack() here but can't because of bug #98372
    >>> browser.open('http://answers.launchpad.dev/ubuntu/+question/5/+edit')
    >>> browser.getControl('Welsh').selected = True
    >>> browser.getControl('Summary').value = 'Gofyn cymorth'
    >>> browser.getControl('Continue').click()

    >>> browser.url
    'http://answers.launchpad.dev/ubuntu/+question/5/+edit'

    >>> for tag in find_tags_by_class(browser.contents, 'warning message'):
    ...     print tag.renderContents()
    <strong>Welsh (cy)</strong> doesn't seem to be
    a language spoken by any answer contacts in this community. If you
    go ahead and ask a question in that language, no answer
    contacts will be able to read it. Currently, the languages spoken
    by at least one answer contact are: English, Portuguese (Brazil).

If he changes the language to another unsupported language, he will
get another warning.

    >>> browser.getControl('Language').value = ['ja']
    >>> browser.getControl('Summary').value = (
    ...     u'\u52a9\u3051\u306e\u8981\u6c42'.encode('utf-8'))
    >>> browser.getControl('Continue').click()

    >>> for tag in find_tags_by_class(browser.contents, 'warning message'):
    ...     print tag.renderContents()
    <strong>Japanese (ja)</strong> doesn't seem to be
    a language spoken by any answer contacts in this community. If you
    go ahead and ask a question in that language, no answer
    contacts will be able to read it. Currently, the languages spoken
    by at least one answer contact are: English, Portuguese (Brazil).

If even after the warning he decides to go ahead, the unsupported
language is accepted.

    >>> browser.getControl('Continue').click()
    >>> browser.url
    '.../ubuntu/+question/5'
    >>> browser.title.decode('utf-8')
    u'Ubuntu question #...\u52a9\u3051\u306e\u8981\u6c42...'
    >>> soup = find_main_content(browser.contents)
    >>> print soup.find('b', text='Language:').next.strip()
    Japanese
