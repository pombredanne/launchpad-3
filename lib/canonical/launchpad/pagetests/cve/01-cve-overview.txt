Malone supports the CVE database system. These pages will test that
functionality.

First, we view the Malone home page. We expect to see a link to the CVE
tracker on that page.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /malone HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...<a href=".../malone/cve/">CVE Tracker</a>...

Now we view the CVE tracker. We should see a link to a page showing all the
CVE entries. We should also see the latest 5 CVE entries modified or created 
in the system.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /malone/cve/ HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...CVE-2005-2737 (Candidate)...
  ...CVE-2005-2736 (Candidate)...
  ...<a href=".../malone/cve/+all">All Registered CVEs</a>...

Now, we will test the search functionality of the CVE tracker. First we
will search for the word "loss" in the database and see how many show
up. We expect to see CVE-1999-2345.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... POST /malone/cve/ HTTP/1.1
  ... Content-Length: 9
  ... Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
  ... 
  ... text=loss""")
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...Matches: 1...
  ...CVE-1999-2345 (Candidate)...


Finally, let's put a CVE number in there. We expect to jump straight to that
CVE.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... POST /malone/cve/ HTTP/1.1
  ... Content-Length: 14
  ... Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
  ... 
  ... text=2005-2737""")
  HTTP/1.1 303 See Other
  ...
  Location: http://.../malone/cve/2005-2737
  ...

OK, let's look at the CVE page for 2005-2737. We expect to see a few
references.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /malone/cve/2005-2737 HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability...
