Let's take a tour of the Launchpad specification management system.

First, we should be able to see a list of latest specs on any product or
distribution in Launchpad. This should take the form of a portlet on the
product or distribution home page, showing latest specs.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /firefox HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...Latest blueprints...
  ...Support E4X in EcmaScript...

If there are no specifications, then we should not see the "latest
specifications" portlet.

  >>> result = http(r"""
  ... GET /debian/ HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  >>> 'Latest blueprints' not in str(result)
  True


On both product and distribution we should be able to see a list of
specifications, at +specs.

First, let's check on product.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /evolution/+specs HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...

Now, on distribution.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /debian/+specs HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...


And we should see the latest specifications available for the whole system:

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /specs/ HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...Recently registered...


Which should also support searching:

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /specs/?searchtext=svg HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...blueprint(s) matching...svg...
  ...Support Native SVG Objects...
