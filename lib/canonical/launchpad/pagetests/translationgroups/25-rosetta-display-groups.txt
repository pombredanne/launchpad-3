Now, let's have a look at the Rosetta page. We should see the new
translation group in a portlet on that page.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /rosetta/ HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...Rosetta: Translations in the Launchpad...
  ...Translation groups in Rosetta:...
  .../rosetta/groups/polyglot/...The PolyGlot Translation Group...

Also, we should get the group showing up on the groups display page for
Rosetta.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /rosetta/groups/ HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...Rosetta Translation Groups...
  ...The PolyGlot Translation Group...
