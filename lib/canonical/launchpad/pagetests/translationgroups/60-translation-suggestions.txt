We are going to test the system by which rosetta provides alternative
translation suggestions. This will need to be updated when we change the
presentation of these items.

This test is going to work with evolution source package for Ubuntu Hoary.
As part of this history, we have Hoary distro release with CLOSED permissions
and with the Polyglot translation team in charge of its translations.

Let's add a new suggestion as a person without privileges.

  >>> browser.addHeader("Authorization", "Basic no-priv@canonical.com:test")
  >>> browser.open(
  ...     'http://translations.launchpad.dev/ubuntu/hoary/+source/evolution/'
  ...     '+pots/evolution-2.2/es/+translate')
  >>> browser.getControl(
  ...     name='msgset_134_es_translation_0_new_checkbox').value = True
  >>> browser.getControl(
  ...     name='msgset_134_es_translation_0_new').value = 'new suggestion'
  >>> browser.getControl(name='submit_translations').click()
  >>> print browser.url
  http://translations.launchpad.dev/ubuntu/hoary/+source/evolution/+pots/evolution-2.2/es/+translate?start=10
  >>> browser.getLink('Previous').click()

  >>> #import sys; print >>sys.stderr, browser.contents

Now, we can see the added suggestion + others from the sample data.

  >>> print find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, "msgset_134_es_suggestion_703_0")
  <...<samp> </samp>new suggestion...
  >>> print find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, "msgset_134_es_suggestion_703_0_origin")
  <...
  ...Suggested by...No Privileges Person...

These are old suggestions:

  >>> print find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, "msgset_134_es_suggestion_698_0")
  <...<samp> </samp>Srprise! (non-editor)...
  >>> print find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, "msgset_134_es_suggestion_698_0_origin")
  <...
  ...Suggested by...Valentina Commissari...2005-06-06...


  >>> print find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, "msgset_134_es_suggestion_696_0")
  <...<samp> </samp>bang bang in evo hoary...
  >>> print find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, "msgset_134_es_suggestion_696_0_origin")
  <...
  ...Suggested in...evolution-2.2 in Evolution trunk...
  ...Mark Shuttleworth</a>...2005-06-06...

And there's also a separate translation coming from upstream:

  >>> print find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, "msgset_134_packaged")
  <...<samp> </samp>tarjetas...
  >>> print find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, "msgset_134_packaged_origin")
  <...
