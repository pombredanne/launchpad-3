== Inline help ==

All Launchpad pages contain an invisible help frame.

    >>> anon_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/')
    >>> find_tag_by_id(anon_browser.contents, 'help-pane')
    <div...

XXX 20080618 mpt: This frame should actually not be omnipresent; it
should be created only when a help link is clicked (bug 241020). When
that is fixed, this test can be deleted (or replaced with a Selenium
test, if we have those by then).
