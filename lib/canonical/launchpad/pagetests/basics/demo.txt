Launchpad can brand instances as 'demo' instances to make it obvious to
users that they are working in a playpen and changes they make do not
affect the production systems.

This is controlled by a config variable.

    >>> from canonical.config import config
    >>> config.launchpad.is_demo
    False

    >>> config.launchpad.is_demo = True
    >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/')
    >>> print browser.contents
    <...
    <style...url(/@@/demo)...</style>
    ...
    <div id="copyright">...DEMO...</div>
    ...

    >>> config.launchpad.is_demo = False
    >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev')
    >>> 'DEMO' in browser.contents
    False

We could hard code this behavior for certain database names, as was done
in the past, but using an explicit config option future proofs us against
future changes, such as using multiple launchpad databases, and makes it
easier to test the feature and see the styling.
