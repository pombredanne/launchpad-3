= Rejecting Tickets =

Support contacts and administrators can reject a support request.
This should be done when the request isn't an actual support request,
for example, if the request is a duplicate or spam.

No Privileges Pesron isn't a support contact or administrator, so he
doesn't have access to that feature.

    # XXX flacoste 2006/10/19 Bug 52077 user_browser should be no-priv
    # We can't use user_browser here because he is Firefox's registrant.
    >>> browser.addHeader('Authorization', 'Basic no-priv@canonical.com:test')
    >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/firefox/+ticket/2')
    >>> browser.getLink('Reject Request')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    LinkNotFoundError...

Even when trying to access the page directly, he will get an unauthorized
error.

    >>> browser.open(
    ...     'http://launchpad.dev/firefox/+ticket/2/+reject')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    Unauthorized: ...

To reject the request, the user clicks on the 'Reject Request' link.

    >>> admin_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/firefox/+ticket/2')
    >>> admin_browser.getLink('Reject Request').click()
    >>> admin_browser.getControl('Reject').click()

He needs to enter a message explaining the rejection:

    >>> from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup
    >>> soup = BeautifulSoup(admin_browser.contents)
    >>> print soup.first('div', 'message').renderContents()
    You must provide an explanation message.

Entering an explanation message and clicking the 'Reject' button,
will reject the ticket.

    >>> admin_browser.getControl('Message').value = (
    ...     """Rejecting because it's a duplicate of bug #1.""")
    >>> admin_browser.getControl('Reject').click()

Once the ticket is rejected, a confirmation message is shown;

    >>> soup = BeautifulSoup(admin_browser.contents)
    >>> print soup.first('div', 'informational message').renderContents()
    You have rejected this request.

its status is changed to 'Invalid';

    >>> print soup.first('b', text='Status:').next.strip()
    Invalid

and the rejection message is added to the ticket board.

    >>> print soup.fetch('div', 'boardCommentBody')[-1].renderContents()
    <p>Rejecting because it's a duplicate of <a...>bug #1</a>.</p>

= Changing the Ticket Status =

In the previous example, that rejection was clearly a mistake: you
shouldn't reject a request because it is related to a bug, for these
case, you should link the request to the bug!

Users who have administrative privileges on the ticket (product or
distribution registrant and Launchpad admins) can correct errors like
these by using the 'Change Status' action. This page enables a user to
set the ticket status to an arbitrary value without workflow constraint.

That action isn't available to a non-privileged user:

    >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/firefox/+ticket/2')
    >>> browser.getLink('Change Status')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    LinkNotFoundError...

The change status form is available to an adminsitrator through the
'Change Status' link.

    >>> admin_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/firefox/+ticket/2')
    >>> admin_browser.getLink('Change Status').click()

The form has a select widget displaying the current status.

    >>> admin_browser.getControl('Status', index=0).value
    ['Invalid']

The user needs to select a status and enter a message explaining the
status change:

    >>> admin_browser.getControl('Change Status').click()
    >>> soup = BeautifulSoup(admin_browser.contents)
    >>> for error in soup.fetch('div', 'message'):
    ...     print error.renderContents()
    You didn't change the status.
    You must provide an explanation message.

To correct the mistake of the previous example, the administrator would
select back the 'Open' status and provide an appropriate message:

    >>> admin_browser.getControl('Status', index=0).value = ['Open']
    >>> admin_browser.getControl('Message').value = (
    ...     "Setting status back to 'Open'. Requests similar to a bug "
    ...     "report should be linked to it, not rejected.")
    >>> admin_browser.getControl('Change Status').click()

Once the operation is completed, a confirmation message is displayed;

    >>> soup = BeautifulSoup(admin_browser.contents)
    >>> print soup.first('div', 'informational message').renderContents()
    Request status updated.

its status is updated;

    >>> print soup.first('b', text='Status:').next.strip()
    Open

and the explanation message is added to the ticket board.

    >>> print soup.fetch('div', 'boardCommentBody')[-1].renderContents()
    <p>Setting status back to 'Open'. Requests similar to a bug report
    should be linked to it, not rejected.</p>
