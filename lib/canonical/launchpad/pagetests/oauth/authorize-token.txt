***************************
Authorizing a request token
***************************

Once the consumer gets a request token, it must send the user to
Launchpad's +authorize-token page in order for the user to authenticate
and authorize or not the consumer to act on his behalf.

    # Create a new request token.
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IOAuthConsumerSet
    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests import ANONYMOUS, login, logout
    >>> login('salgado@ubuntu.com')
    >>> consumer = getUtility(IOAuthConsumerSet).getByKey('foobar123451432')
    >>> token = consumer.newRequestToken()
    >>> logout()

According to the OAuth Core 1.0 spec, the request to the service
provider's user authorization URL (+authorize-token in our case) must
use the HTTP GET method and may include the oauth_callback parameter.
The oauth_token parameter, on the other hand, is required in the
Launchpad implementation.

Access to the page
==================

The +authorize-token page is restricted to authenticated users, but
the actual details of the authentication are different than from any
other part of Launchpad.

    >>> from urllib import urlencode
    >>> params = dict(
    ...     oauth_token=token.key, oauth_callback='http://launchpad.dev/bzr')
    >>> url = "http://launchpad.dev/+authorize-token?%s" % urlencode(params)
    >>> browser.open(url)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    Unauthorized:...

A user who is logged in through Basic Auth can see the page.

    >>> browser = setupBrowser(auth='Basic no-priv@canonical.com:test')
    >>> browser.open(url)
    >>> browser.title
    'Authorize application to access Launchpad on your behalf'

    >>> main_content = find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'maincontent')
    >>> print extract_text(main_content)
    The application identified as foobar123451432 wants to access Launchpad on
    your behalf. What level of access do you want to grant?
    ...
    See all applications authorized to access Launchpad on your behalf.

But a user can also see the page by signing an outgoing request with
an _existing_ OAuth token. This makes it possible for a desktop client
to retrieve this page without navigating the arbitrarily complex
OpenID login procedure.

The OAuth token must have the GRANT_PERMISSIONS access level; no other
access level will work.

Using the page
==============

This page contains one submit button for each item of OAuthPermission,
except for 'Grant Permissions', which must be specifically requested.

    >>> browser.getControl('No Access')
    <SubmitControl...
    >>> browser.getControl('Read Non-Private Data')
    <SubmitControl...
    >>> browser.getControl('Change Non-Private Data')
    <SubmitControl...
    >>> browser.getControl('Read Anything')
    <SubmitControl...
    >>> browser.getControl('Change Anything')
    <SubmitControl...

    >>> browser.getControl('Grant Permissions')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    LookupError: label 'Grant Permissions'

    >>> actions = main_content.findAll('input', attrs={'type': 'submit'})
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.webapp.interfaces import OAuthPermission
    >>> len(actions) == len(OAuthPermission.items) - 1
    True

An application, when asking to access Launchpad on a user's behalf,
may restrict the user to certain items of OAuthPermission. This
prevents annoying cases where the user grants a level of permission
that isn't enough for the application. The user always has the option
to deny permission altogether.

    >>> def print_access_levels(allow_permission):
    ...     browser.open(
    ...         "http://launchpad.dev/+authorize-token?%s&%s"
    ...         % (urlencode(params), allow_permission))
    ...     main_content = find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'maincontent')
    ...     actions = main_content.findAll('input', attrs={'type': 'submit'})
    ...     for action in actions:
    ...         print action['value']

    >>> print_access_levels(
    ...     'allow_permission=WRITE_PUBLIC&allow_permission=WRITE_PRIVATE')
    No Access
    Change Non-Private Data
    Change Anything

The only time the 'Grant Permissions' permission shows up in this list
is if the client specifically requests it, and no other
permission. (Also requesting UNAUTHORIZED is okay--it will show up
anyway.)

    >>> print_access_levels('allow_permission=GRANT_PERMISSIONS')
    No Access
    Grant Permissions

    >>> print_access_levels(
    ...     'allow_permission=GRANT_PERMISSIONS&allow_permission=UNAUTHORIZED')
    No Access
    Grant Permissions

    >>> print_access_levels(
    ...     'allow_permission=WRITE_PUBLIC&allow_permission=GRANT_PERMISSIONS')
    No Access
    Change Non-Private Data

If an application doesn't specify any valid access levels, or only
specifies the UNAUTHORIZED access level, Launchpad will show all the
access levels, except for GRANT_PERMISSIONS.

    >>> print_access_levels('')
    No Access
    Read Non-Private Data
    Change Non-Private Data
    Read Anything
    Change Anything

    >>> print_access_levels('allow_permission=UNAUTHORIZED')
    No Access
    Read Non-Private Data
    Change Non-Private Data
    Read Anything
    Change Anything

An application may also specify a context, so that the access granted
by the user is restricted to things related to that context.

    >>> params_with_context = {'lp.context': 'firefox'}
    >>> params_with_context.update(params)
    >>> browser.open(
    ...     "http://launchpad.dev/+authorize-token?%s"
    ...     % urlencode(params_with_context))
    >>> main_content = find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'maincontent')
    >>> print extract_text(main_content)
    The application...wants to access things related to Mozilla Firefox...

A client other than a web browser may request a JSON representation of
the list of authentication levels.

    >>> import simplejson
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.testing.pages import setupBrowser

    >>> json_browser = setupBrowser()
    >>> json_browser.addHeader('Accept', 'application/json')
    >>> json_browser.addHeader('Authorization',
    ...     'Basic test@canonical.com:test')
    >>> json_browser.open(
    ...     "http://launchpad.dev/+authorize-token?%s"
    ...     % urlencode(params))
    >>> json_token = simplejson.loads(json_browser.contents)
    >>> sorted(json_token.keys())
    ['access_levels', 'oauth_token', 'oauth_token_consumer']

    >>> sorted((level['value'], level['title'])
    ...        for level in json_token['access_levels'])
    [('READ_PRIVATE', 'Read Anything'),
     ('READ_PUBLIC', 'Read Non-Private Data'),
     ('UNAUTHORIZED', 'No Access'),
     ('WRITE_PRIVATE', 'Change Anything'),
     ('WRITE_PUBLIC', 'Change Non-Private Data')]

    >>> json_browser.open(
    ...     ("http://launchpad.dev/+authorize-token?%s"
    ...      "&allow_permission=READ_PRIVATE") % urlencode(params))
    >>> json_token = simplejson.loads(json_browser.contents)
    >>> sorted((level['value'], level['title'])
    ...        for level in json_token['access_levels'])
    [('READ_PRIVATE', 'Read Anything'),
     ('UNAUTHORIZED', 'No Access')]

Once the user authorizes the application to access Launchpad on his
behalf, we issue a redirect to the given oauth_callback (if it was
specified by the application).

    >>> browser.open(
    ...     "http://launchpad.dev/+authorize-token?%s" % urlencode(params))
    >>> browser.getControl('Read Non-Private Data').click()

    # This is the URL given to Launchpad in oauth_callback.
    >>> browser.url
    'http://launchpad.dev/bzr'

After the authorization is granted the token gets its permission and
person set.

    # Need to get the token again as it's been changed in another
    # transaction.
    >>> login(ANONYMOUS)
    >>> token = consumer.getRequestToken(token.key)
    >>> token.person.name
    u'no-priv'
    >>> token.permission
    <DBItem OAuthPermission.READ_PUBLIC...
    >>> token.is_reviewed
    True

If no oauth_callback is specified, we redirect the user to
+authorized-token.

    # Create a new (unreviewed) token.
    >>> logout()
    >>> login('salgado@ubuntu.com')
    >>> token = consumer.newRequestToken()
    >>> logout()

    >>> params = dict(oauth_token=token.key)
    >>> browser.open(
    ...     "http://launchpad.dev/+authorize-token?%s" % urlencode(params))

    >>> browser.getControl('Read Anything').click()

    >>> browser.url
    'http://launchpad.dev/+token-authorized?...'
    >>> print extract_text(find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'maincontent'))
    Almost finished ...
    To finish authorizing the application identified as foobar123451432 to
    access Launchpad on your behalf you should go back to the application
    window in which you started the process and inform it that you have done
    your part of the process.

If we can't find the token, we will explain that to the user.

    >>> params = dict(oauth_callback='http://example.com/oauth')
    >>> browser.open(
    ...     "http://launchpad.dev/+authorize-token?%s" % urlencode(params))
    >>> print extract_text(find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'maincontent'))
    Unable to identify application
    The information provided by the remote application was incorrect or
    incomplete. Because of that we were unable to identify the application
    which would access Launchpad on your behalf.
    See all applications authorized to access Launchpad on your behalf.

    >>> params = dict(

    >>> browser.open(

The same happens if the token is already reviewed.  Although that's
probably an indication that the user has already reviewed that token in
another window/tab so there's no need to worry.

    # Need to get the token again as it's been changed in another
    # transaction.
    >>> token = consumer.getRequestToken(token.key)
    >>> token.is_reviewed
    True
    >>> params = dict(
    ...     oauth_token=token.key, oauth_callback='http://example.com/oauth')
    >>> browser.open(
    ...     "http://launchpad.dev/+authorize-token?%s" % urlencode(params))
    >>> print extract_text(find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'maincontent'))
