= Joining a team =

Karl will join the newly created team.

    >>> browser = setupBrowser(auth='Basic karl@canonical.com:test')
    >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~myemail')
    >>> print extract_text(
    ...     find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'subscription_policy'))
    Open Team:
    Any user can join and no approval is required.

    >>> browser.getLink('Join the team').click()
    >>> browser.url
    'http://launchpad.dev/~myemail/+join'

    >>> browser.getControl(name='join').click()
    >>> browser.url
    'http://launchpad.dev/~myemail'

Since this is an open team, he's automatically approved.

    >>> for tag in find_tags_by_class(browser.contents, 'informational'):
    ...     print tag.renderContents()
    Successfully joined my own team.

Now, the link to join the team is not present anymore and the +join page will
say that there's no need to join since the user is already a member of that
team.

    >>> browser.getLink('Join the team')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    LinkNotFoundError
    >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~myemail/+join')
    >>> for tag in find_tags_by_class(browser.contents, 'warning'):
    ...     print tag.renderContents()
    You are an active member of this team already.

We have a 'Back to team' button, though, which just takes the user back to
the team's home page.

    >>> browser.getControl('Back to team').click()
    >>> browser.url
    'http://launchpad.dev/~myemail'

If this was a moderated team, the membership would not have been automatically
approved, though.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import Person
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import TeamSubscriptionPolicy
    >>> myemail = Person.selectOneBy(name='myemail')
    >>> myemail.subscriptionpolicy = TeamSubscriptionPolicy.MODERATED
    >>> myemail.syncUpdate()

    >>> browser = setupBrowser(
    ...     auth='Basic james.blackwell@ubuntulinux.com:jblack')
    >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~myemail')
    >>> print extract_text(
    ...     find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'subscription_policy'))
    Moderated Team:
    All subscriptions for this team are subject to approval by one of
    the team's administrators.

    >>> browser.getLink('Join the team').click()
    >>> browser.url
    'http://launchpad.dev/~myemail/+join'

    >>> print find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'maincontent').renderContents()
    <BLANKLINE>
    ...
    Since this is a moderated team, one of its administrators will have to
    approve your membership before you actually become a member of this team.
    ...

If the user changes his mind because this is a moderated team, he can hit
the 'Cancel' button, going back to the team's page...

    >>> browser.getControl('Cancel').click()
    >>> browser.url
    'http://launchpad.dev/~myemail'

...and then do everything again, if he really wants to join.

    >>> browser.getLink('Join the team').click()
    >>> browser.getControl(name='join').click()
    >>> browser.url
    'http://launchpad.dev/~myemail'

    >>> for tag in find_tags_by_class(browser.contents, 'informational'):
    ...     print tag.renderContents()
    Subscription request pending approval.

If it was a restricted team, users wouldn't even see a link to join the team.

    >>> myemail.subscriptionpolicy = TeamSubscriptionPolicy.RESTRICTED
    >>> myemail.syncUpdate()

    >>> browser = setupBrowser(
    ...     auth='Basic jeff.waugh@ubuntulinux.com:jdub')
    >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~myemail')
    >>> browser.url
    'http://launchpad.dev/~myemail'
    >>> print extract_text(
    ...     find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'subscription_policy'))
    Restricted Team:
    New members can only be added by one of the team's administrators.

    >>> browser.getLink('Join the team')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    LinkNotFoundError

If the user manually craft the URL to the +join page, he'll only see a
message explaining that this is a restricted team.

    >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~myemail/+join')
    >>> browser.url
    'http://launchpad.dev/~myemail/+join'

    >>> for tag in find_tags_by_class(browser.contents, 'warning'):
    ...     print tag.renderContents()
    my own team is a restricted team.
    Only a team administrator can add new members.

But we provide a 'Back to team' button to take the user back to the team's
home page, since he can't join it.

    >>> browser.getControl('Back to team').click()
    >>> browser.url
    'http://launchpad.dev/~myemail'

On the team's +members page we can now see Karl as an approved member,
James Blackwell as a proposed one and Jeff Waugh won't be there at all.

    >>> anon_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~myemail')
    >>> anon_browser.getLink('Show all members').click()
    >>> anon_browser.url
    'http://launchpad.dev/~myemail/+members'

    >>> contents = anon_browser.contents
    >>> for link in find_tag_by_id(contents, 'activemembers').findAll('a'):
    ...     print link.renderContents()
    Karl Tilbury 
    Sample Person

    >>> for link in find_tag_by_id(contents, 'proposedmembers').findAll('a'):
    ...     print link.renderContents()
    James Blackwell
