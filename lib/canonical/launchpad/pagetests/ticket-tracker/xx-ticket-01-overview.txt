The Launchpad Ticket Tracker
============================

Launchpad has a "tech support request tracker" built in to it. So you can
have your community provide technical support using Launchpad for any
upstream application, or any distribution.

First, lets look at a product page. We should see the "Tickets" link.  There is
no action menu item allowing us to "Request Support", as this is available only
on the Support facet.  We will look at Firefox, and based on the sampledata we
expect there to be three support tickets.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /products/firefox HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  .../products/firefox/+tickets">Support...
  ...Latest Mozilla Firefox...Support Requests:...
  ...+ticket/4">Firefox loses focus and gets stuck...
  ...Problem showing the SVG demo on W3C site...
  ...Firefox cannot render Bank Site...


On a distribution we also expect to see the Tickets link.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /distros/ubuntu HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  .../distros/ubuntu/+tickets">Support...
  ...Latest...Support Requests:...


On a distrorelease we will see a "Request Support" link, but note that it
points at its distro, not itself. Support tickets are linked to distro, and
optionally source package too.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /distros/ubuntu/hoary HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  .../distros/ubuntu/+addticket">Request Support...

On a source package we should see the Support facet menu link.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /distros/ubuntu/hoary/+source/evolution HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  .../distros/ubuntu/hoary/+source/evolution/+tickets">Support...
  ...Latest...Support Requests:...

And on the source package's Support page, we should see "Request Support".

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /distros/ubuntu/hoary/+source/evolution/+tickets HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...+addticket">Request Support...

The +tickets page for a Product should similarly link to "Request Support".

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /products/gnomebaker/+tickets HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...
  ...+addticket">Request Support...
  ...

And on a Distribution.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /distros/ubuntu/+tickets HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...

And on a Source Package.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /distros/ubuntu/hoary/+source/evolution/+tickets HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...

Now, let's look at a ticket.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /products/firefox/+ticket/2 HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...
