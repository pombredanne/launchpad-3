Adding a comment or review to a merge proposal will take the user back
to the main merge proposal page.

    >>> anon_browser.open(merge_proposal_url)
    >>> def print_comments(klass, browser=None, index=0):
    ...     if browser is None:
    ...         browser = anon_browser
    ...     tags = find_tags_by_class(browser.contents, klass)
    ...     for count, tag in enumerate(tags):
    ...         if count == index:
    ...             print extract_text(tag)

    >>> print_comments('boardCommentDetails')
    Eric the Viking wrote ...
    >>> print_comments('boardCommentBody')
    my body
    >>> print_comments('commentSuffix')
    Reply

The person's name links back to the main site for that person.

    >>> print anon_browser.getLink('Eric the Viking').url
    http://launchpad.dev/~eric

Reply link is displayed even if the user isn't logged in.

    >>> anon_browser.getLink('Reply').click()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    Unauthorized:...

We can reply to a comment.

    >>> eric_browser.open(merge_proposal_url)
    >>> eric_browser.getLink('Reply').click()
    >>> eric_browser.getControl(name='field.comment').value = ('I like this.\n'
    ... 'I wish I had time to review it properly\n\n'
    ... 'This is a longer\nmessage with several\nlines')
    >>> eric_browser.getControl(name='field.actions.add').click()

After this, we are taken to the main page for the merge proposal

The comment is shown in full, but hidden, and is shown with javascipt.
The shorter comment is shown with a hyperlink to show the full comment.
If javascript is not available, the link takes the user to a view that
shows the entire message.

If the summary is over three lines, then it ends with an ellipsis.

    >>> print_comments(
    ...     'boardCommentBody', eric_browser, index=2) #doctest: -ELLIPSIS
    I like this.
    I wish I had time to review it properly ...
    (show full message)

    >>> eric_browser.getLink('show full message').click()
    >>> print_comments('boardCommentBody', eric_browser)
    I like this.
    I wish I had time to review it properly
    This is a longer message with several lines

The comment's view page has a link that takes us back to the merge proposal.

    >>> eric_browser.getLink('Back to merge proposal').click()
    >>> bool(eric_browser.url == merge_proposal_url)
    True


== Reviewing ==

When replying normally there is only a comment field shown.  If the user
wants to review the branch, they click on the [Review] link shown in the
vote summary table.

    >>> eric_browser.getLink('[Review]').click()
    >>> eric_browser.getControl('Reviewer says').displayValue = ['Abstain']
    >>> eric_browser.getControl('Review type').value = 'timeless'
    >>> eric_browser.getControl('Save Review').click()

    >>> print_comments('boardCommentDetails', eric_browser, index=3)
    timeless Abstain   Eric the Viking voted ...second...ago
    >>> print_comments('boardCommentBody', eric_browser, index=3)


== Vote summaries ==

The summary of the votes that have been made for a code review are shown
in a table at the top of the page.

    >>> print extract_text(find_tag_by_id(
    ...     eric_browser.contents, 'code-review-votes'))
    Reviewer         Review Type    Date Requested    Status
