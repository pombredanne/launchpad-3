If a branch fails to mirror, that information is displayed in the mirror's
page, together with the last failure message we got when mirroring.

    >>> anon_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~jblack/+junk/devel-1.0')
    >>> content = anon_browser.contents
    >>> mirror_failure_tag = find_tag_by_id(content, 'mirror-failure')
    >>> print extract_text(mirror_failure_tag)
    This branch has not been mirrored, as Launchpad has been unable to
    access it.

If a branch failed to mirror but no failure message was stored, we properly
report the absence of an error message.

    >>> anon_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~stevea/thunderbird/main')
    >>> content = anon_browser.contents
    >>> mirror_failure_tag = find_tag_by_id(content, 'mirror-failure')
    >>> print extract_text(mirror_failure_tag)
    This branch has not been mirrored, as Launchpad has been unable to
    access it.

If a branch has a sftp or bzr+ssh URL, immediately display an error message
(even before mirroring is attempted) and do not display the mirror failure
message.

XXX: We need to use flush_database_updates before every commit for the test
browser to see the changes we make to the content object. See bug 3989.

    >>> import transaction
    >>> from canonical.database.sqlbase import flush_database_updates
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import BranchSet
    >>> thunderbird_main = BranchSet().getByUniqueName(
    ...     '~stevea/thunderbird/main')
    >>> thunderbird_main.url = 'sftp://example.com/thunderbird'
    >>> flush_database_updates()
    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> anon_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~stevea/thunderbird/main')
    >>> content = anon_browser.contents
    >>> print find_tag_by_id(content, 'mirror-failure')
    None
    >>> mirror_of_ssh_tag = find_tag_by_id(content, 'mirror-of-ssh')
    >>> print extract_text(mirror_of_ssh_tag)
    Launchpad cannot mirror this branch because its URL uses sftp or bzr+ssh.


Ultimately, if a branch was successfully mirrored, then we obviously won't
display any failure-related information.

    >>> anon_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~name12/gnome-terminal/2.6')
    >>> content = anon_browser.contents
    >>> print find_tag_by_id(content, 'mirror-failure')
    None
