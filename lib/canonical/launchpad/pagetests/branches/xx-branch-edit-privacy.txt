= Changing branch privacy =

Which users can have private branches is controlled by
the branch visibility policy (see doc/branch-visibility-policy.txt).
This controls the initial visibility of branches created by users
in particular namespaces, either their own or teams that the user is
a member of.

Once the branch is created, the user is able to change a public branch
to private or a private branch to public in certain circumstances.


== Branches with no visibility policy ==

If there is no policy set, then the user is not able to change the visiblity
of the branch.

    >>> browser = setupBrowser(auth='Basic test@canonical.com:test')
    >>> browser.open('http://code.launchpad.dev/~name12/firefox/main')
    >>> browser.getLink('Change branch details').click()
    >>> browser.getControl('Keep branch confidential')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    LookupError: label 'Keep branch confidential'


== Private branches allowed ==

Allow the Warty Security Team to have private firefox branches.

    >>> admin_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/firefox/+branchvisibility')
    >>> admin_browser.getLink('Customise policy for Mozilla Firefox').click()
    >>> admin_browser.getControl('Team', index=0).value = 'name20'
    >>> print_radio_button_field(admin_browser.contents, 'rule')
    ( ) Public
    (*) Private
    ( ) Private only
    >>> admin_browser.getControl('Set Team Policy').click()

Now Sample Person, who is a member of the Warty Security Team should be
able to mark the branch as private.

    >>> browser.open('http://code.launchpad.dev/~name12/firefox/main')
    >>> browser.getLink('Change branch details').click()
    >>> browser.getControl('Keep branch confidential').selected = True
    >>> browser.getControl('Change Branch').click()

Since the branch is now private, it will have the standard Launchpad
presentation for private things.

    >>> print extract_text(find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'privacy'))
    This branch is private

If Sample Person changes the branch from private back to public, the page
reverts to its normal presentation.

    >>> browser.getLink('Change branch details').click()
    >>> browser.getControl('Keep branch confidential').selected = False
    >>> browser.getControl('Change Branch').click()
    >>> print extract_text(find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'privacy'))
    This branch is public


== Private Only branches ==

If the policy specifies private only, then the user is able to make
a public branch private, but not vice versa.

    >>> admin_browser.getLink('Set policy for a team').click()
    >>> admin_browser.getControl('Team', index=0).value = 'name20'
    >>> admin_browser.getControl('Private only').click()
    >>> admin_browser.getControl('Set Team Policy').click()

Mark the public branch private.

    >>> browser.getLink('Change branch details').click()
    >>> browser.getControl('Keep branch confidential').selected = True
    >>> browser.getControl('Change Branch').click()

The branch is now private, so it assumes the standard private presentation.

    >>> print extract_text(find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'privacy'))
    This branch is private

However when the user now looks to edit the branch details, there
is no option to mark the branch as public.

    >>> browser.getLink('Change branch details').click()
    >>> browser.getControl('Keep branch confidential')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    LookupError: label 'Keep branch confidential'
