= Branch Merge Proposals =

Branch merge proposals are where you show the intent of merging
the code from one branch into another.

Any logged in user can register a merge proposal.  Registering
a merge proposal is done from the source branch, and the link
is `Propose for merging`.


== Registering a merge proposal ==

Users who are not logged on do not see the link to register.

    >>> anon_browser.open(
    ...     'http://code.launchpad.dev/~name12/gnome-terminal/klingon')
    >>> anon_browser.getLink('Propose for merging')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    LinkNotFoundError

Logged in users can.

    >>> nopriv_browser = setupBrowser(auth="Basic no-priv@canonical.com:test")
    >>> nopriv_browser.open(
    ...     'http://code.launchpad.dev/~name12/gnome-terminal/klingon')
    >>> nopriv_browser.getLink('Propose for merging').click()
    >>> nopriv_browser.getControl('Target Branch').value = (
    ...     '~name12/gnome-terminal/main')
    >>> nopriv_browser.getControl('Whiteboard').value = (
    ...     'This is the whiteboard')
    >>> nopriv_browser.getControl('Register').click()

Registering the merge proposal takes the user back to the
main page for the source branch.

    >>> print nopriv_browser.url
    http://code.launchpad.dev/~name12/gnome-terminal/klingon

Most of the time the merge proposal is looked at from the point
of view of either the source branch or the target branch.


== Landing Targets ==

When looked at from the point of view of the source branch, the
merge proposal is considered a "landing target" with an optional
"dependent branch".

    >>> def printMergeProposals(browser, id):
    ...     tag = find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, id)
    ...     if tag is None:
    ...         print tag
    ...     else:
    ...         for mp in tag.findAll(attrs={'class': 'mergeproposal'}):
    ...             print extract_text(mp)

    >>> printMergeProposals(nopriv_browser, 'landing-targets')
    ~name12/gnome-terminal/main

Since the user who registered the merge proposal is different
to the owner of the source branch, they are shown explicitly.
If the branch owner registers the merge proposal, they are not
shown.

    >>> sample_browser = setupBrowser(auth="Basic test@canonical.com:test")
    >>> sample_browser.open(
    ...     'http://code.launchpad.dev/~name12/gnome-terminal/scanned')
    >>> sample_browser.getLink('Propose for merging').click()
    >>> sample_browser.getControl('Target Branch').value = (
    ...     '~name12/gnome-terminal/main')
    >>> sample_browser.getControl('Whiteboard').value = (
    ...     'This is the whiteboard')
    >>> sample_browser.getControl('Register').click()

    >>> printMergeProposals(sample_browser, 'landing-targets')
    ~name12/gnome-terminal/main
    This is the whiteboard


== Landing Candidates ==

From the point of view of the target branch, the proposals are
"landing candidates".  The most recently created merge proposals are
shown first.

    >>> browser.open(
    ...     'http://code.launchpad.dev/~name12/gnome-terminal/main')
    >>> printMergeProposals(browser, 'landing-candidates')
    ~name12/gnome-terminal/scanned (New)
      This is the whiteboard
    ~name12/gnome-terminal/klingon (Experimental)

== Editing a merge proposal ==

The branch merge poposal can be edited by the owner of the source or
target branches or the registrant of the merge proposal.

There are currently three tasks that can be done when editing a merge proposal:
  * change the whiteboard
  * delete it
  * mark as merged

If the user is able to edit the merge proposal, then a pencil icon is shown
that is linked to the edit page url.

    >>> landing_targets = find_tag_by_id(
    ...     sample_browser.contents, 'landing-targets')
    >>> edit_link = landing_targets.fetch('a')[1]['href']
    >>> print edit_link
    /~name12/gnome-terminal/scanned/+merge/2
    >>> sample_browser.getLink(url=edit_link).click()
    >>> print sample_browser.title
    Edit branch merge proposal
    >>> sample_browser.getControl('Whiteboard').value = (
    ...     "This is the updated whiteboard.\n"
    ...     "Demo url: http://launchpad.dev/+foo")
    >>> sample_browser.getControl('Update').click()
    >>> printMergeProposals(sample_browser, 'landing-targets')
    ~name12/gnome-terminal/main
    This is the updated whiteboard.
    Demo url: http://launchpad.dev/+foo


== Deleting merge proposals ==

Merge proposals can be deleted, when either abandoned or created in error.
When a merge proposal is deleted, the user is taken back to the main page
for the source_branch.

    >>> sample_browser.getLink(url=edit_link).click()
    >>> sample_browser.getControl('Delete').click()
    >>> print sample_browser.url
    http://code.launchpad.dev/~name12/gnome-terminal/scanned

    >>> printMergeProposals(sample_browser, 'landing-targets')
    None


== Dependent Branches ==

When registering merge proposals, there is an optional dependent branch.
This is used when the source branch has branched of a branch other than
the target branch.

    >>> sample_browser.getLink('Propose for merging').click()
    >>> sample_browser.getControl('Target Branch').value = (
    ...     '~name12/gnome-terminal/main')
    >>> sample_browser.getControl('Dependent Branch').value = (
    ...     '~name12/gnome-terminal/klingon')
    >>> sample_browser.getControl('Whiteboard').value = (
    ...     'This is the whiteboard')
    >>> sample_browser.getControl('Register').click()

    >>> printMergeProposals(sample_browser, 'landing-targets')
    ~name12/gnome-terminal/main
    This is the whiteboard
    Dependent on ~name12/gnome-terminal/klingon

This association is also shown on the branch that is depended upon.

    >>> sample_browser.getLink('~name12/gnome-terminal/klingon').click()
    >>> printMergeProposals(sample_browser, 'dependent-branches')
    ~name12/gnome-terminal/scanned
    This is the whiteboard


== Marking as merged ==

When a branch has been merged into the target branch, the proposal should
be marked as merged.

Merged proposals are still listed on the source branch, but no longer shown
on the target branch.

    >>> nopriv_browser.open(
    ...     'http://code.launchpad.dev/~name12/gnome-terminal/klingon')
    >>> landing_targets = find_tag_by_id(
    ...     nopriv_browser.contents, 'landing-targets')

The edit link is shown after the branch link.

    >>> edit_link = landing_targets.fetch('a')[1]['href']
    >>> nopriv_browser.getLink(url=edit_link).click()

There is an action link here to mark as merged.

    >>> nopriv_browser.getLink('Mark as merged').click()

When marking a proposal as merged there is an optional revision number.
If this is set then the when setting the merge proposal as merged the
system looks for the revision in the history of the target branch,
and if found uses the revision date as the merged date.  If it cannot
find one, then the current time is used as the date merged.

    >>> nopriv_browser.getControl('Merged Revision Number').value = '42'
    >>> nopriv_browser.getControl('Mark as Merged').click()

The user is then taken to the source branch details page.

    >>> printMergeProposals(nopriv_browser, 'landing-targets')
    ~name12/gnome-terminal/main
      This is the whiteboard
      Merge proposed by No Privileges Person
      Merged ... seconds ago as revision 42

Gone from the target branch.

    >>> nopriv_browser.getLink('~name12/gnome-terminal/main').click()
    >>> printMergeProposals(nopriv_browser, 'landing-candidates')
    ~name12/gnome-terminal/scanned (New)
      This is the whiteboard
