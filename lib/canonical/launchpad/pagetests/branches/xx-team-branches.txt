The branch administrative form allows ownership to be transferred to a
team.

Ensure that team owned branches are listed on a product's branch
overview page:

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /products/gnome-terminal/+branches HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...
  ...<a href="http://localhost:9000/people/launchpad/+branch/gnome-terminal/launchpad">Launchpad support for Gnome Terminal</a>...
  ...

Ensure that a branch owned by a team can be viewed:

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /people/launchpad/+branch/gnome-terminal/launchpad HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...
