= Branch Details =

== Recent Revisions ==

On the Code site, registered branches are reached by
/<owner>/<product>/<branch-name>.

  >>> user_browser.open('http://code.launchpad.dev/~name12/+branch/+junk/junk.dev')
  >>> main = find_tag_by_id(user_browser.contents, 'mainarea')


=== Heading ===

We display the recent revisions of a branch if it has been scanned. There's a
"Recent revisions" heading:

  >>> for heading in main.fetch('h2'):
  ...     print heading.renderContents()
  Recent revisions
  ...


=== Revision information ===

Underneath that heading we see the ten most-recent revisions of the branch in
reverse-chronological order.

  >>> for revision_list in main.fetch('ol'):
  ...     for revision in revision_list.fetch('li'):
  ...         revno = str(revision['value'])
  ...         for heading in revision.fetch('div'):
  ...             print revno, extract_text(heading).encode('ascii')
  6 By foo &lt;foo@localhost&gt; on 2005-10-31
  5 By foo &lt;foo@localhost&gt; on 2005-10-31
  4 By bar@localhost on 2005-10-31
  3 By Sample Committer &lt;test@canonical.com&gt; on 2005-10-31
  2 By Sample Committer &lt;test@canonical.com&gt; on 2005-10-31
  1 By Sample Committer &lt;test@canonical.com&gt; on 2005-10-31


=== Email addresses ===

Commit messages often (always?) have email addresses associated with them.
'Revision information' shows that the addresses are shown to logged in users.
However, emails should *not* be shown to anonymous users.

In particular, we don't want search engine and spam bots harvesting email
addresses.

  >>> anon_browser.open('http://code.launchpad.dev/~name12/+branch/+junk/junk.dev')
  >>> anon_main = find_tag_by_id(anon_browser.contents, 'mainarea')
  >>> for revision_list in anon_main.fetch('ol'):
  ...     for revision in revision_list.fetch('li'):
  ...         revno = str(revision['value'])
  ...         for heading in revision.fetch('div'):
  ...             print revno, extract_text(heading).encode('ascii')
  6 By foo on 2005-10-31
  5 By foo on 2005-10-31
  4 By &lt;email address hidden&gt; on 2005-10-31
  3 By Sample Committer on 2005-10-31
  2 By Sample Committer on 2005-10-31

=== Excursis ===

In terms of HTML, each commit is contained in a <div> with an id of "revN",
where "N" is the revision sequence number.

The revision number, author and date are all contained in a heading (h3), and
the commit message follows as a number of paragraphs.

  >>> def get_commit_message(sequence):
  ...     revision = find_tag_by_id(user_browser.contents, 'rev%s' % (sequence,))
  ...     return revision.fetch('p')


=== Commit messages ===

The commit message is displayed in paragraphs underneath the revision id and
author.

  >>> for paragraph in get_commit_message(6):
  ...     print paragraph.renderContents()
  fix bug in bar


When a commit message refers to a bug using the form "bug <bugnumber>", a link
to that bug is created.

  >>> for paragraph in get_commit_message(3):
  ...     print paragraph.renderContents()
  fix <a ...>bug 1</a>


This link can be followed to the bug's details page.

  >>> user_browser.getLink('bug 1').click()
  >>> print user_browser.title
  Bug #1 in firefox (upstream)...


== Unscanned branches ==

Some branches won't have any revisions in the database. Sometimes, this is
simply because the branch is empty. However, much of the time, the lack of
revisions will be because of an error or delay in the scanning process.

Before we can display the revisions, a branch needs to be mirrored (or
'published') and scanned. When a branch is not yet mirrored, we'll see a
helpful message.

  >>> browser.open('http://code.launchpad.dev/~name12/firefox/main')
  >>> print find_main_content(browser.contents)
  <...
  ...Recent revisions...
  ...This branch has not been mirrored yet...


We don't want to use the word 'mirrored' for hosted or imported branches,
because those branches are only mirrored internally. "Published" is a better
word for these.

  >>> browser.open('http://code.launchpad.dev/~name12/gnome-terminal/pushed')
  >>> print find_main_content(browser.contents)
  <...
  ...Recent revisions...
  ...This branch has not been published yet...


If a branch has been mirrored, but not scanned, we display a different message.
This is helpful particularly for hosted and imported branches, which are
available for download as soon as they are published.

  >>> browser.open('http://code.launchpad.dev/~name12/gnome-terminal/mirrored')
  >>> print find_main_content(browser.contents)
  <...
  ...Recent revisions...
  ...This branch has not been scanned yet...


If a branch has been mirrored and scanned, and has no revisions, then it is
empty.

  >>> browser.open('http://code.launchpad.dev/~name12/gnome-terminal/scanned')
  >>> print find_main_content(browser.contents)
  <...
  ...Recent revisions...
  ...This branch is empty...
