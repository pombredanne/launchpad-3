= Person Views of Branch Lists =

There are several views of the branches related to a person.

Branch lists for people also include branches that are owned by
teams that the person is participating in.


== Related Branches ==

First, check that the condensed branch listing page works:

  >>> browser = setupBrowser(auth='Basic test@canonical.com:test')
  >>> browser.open('http://code.launchpad.dev/~name12')
  >>> print browser.title
  Bazaar branches related to Sample Person

The heading in the main content is the same as the page title text.

  >>> main = find_main_content(browser.contents)
  >>> print extract_text(main.h1)
  Bazaar branches related to Sample Person

If a person does not have any related branches, we print an informative
message.

  >>> browser.open('http://code.launchpad.dev/~kinnison')
  >>> print find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'no-branch-message').renderContents()
  There may be branches related to Daniel Silverstone but none
  of them match the current filter criteria for this page. Try
  filtering on "Any Status".

OK, lets follow the advice.

  >>> browser.getControl(name='field.lifecycle').displayValue = ['Any Status']
  >>> browser.getControl('Filter').click()
  >>> print find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'no-branch-message').renderContents()
  There are no branches related to Daniel Silverstone in Launchpad today.
  You can use Launchpad as a registry for Bazaar branches, and encourage
  broader community participation in your project using
  distributed version control.


== Default view for a person on code root site ==

The default view for a person on the code root site is the
normal branch listing view for that person.

  >>> browser.open('http://code.launchpad.dev/~kinnison')
  >>> print find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'no-branch-message').renderContents()
  There may be branches related to Daniel Silverstone but none
  of them match the current filter criteria for this page. Try
  filtering on "Any Status".


== Authored Branches ==

There is a link in the branch context menu for person which points to
the authored branches page.

   >>> browser.open('http://code.launchpad.dev/~name12')
   >>> browser.getLink('Show authored branches').click()
   >>> print browser.title
   Bazaar branches authored by Sample Person
   >>> table = find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'branchtable')
   >>> for row in table.tbody.fetch('tr'):
   ...     print extract_text(row)
   main         ... New           firefox
