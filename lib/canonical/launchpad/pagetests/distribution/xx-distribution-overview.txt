= Distributions =

Launchpad can be used by both upstream projects and distributions - the
system understands the intrinsic differences between those kinds of
organisation. This test just ensures we can view the distributions in the
system.

== Distribution listings ==

There is a listing of all distributions at /distributions/:

    >>> anon_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/distros/')
    >>> print anon_browser.title
    Distributions registered in Launchpad

== Distribution home pages ==

Each distribution has a home page in the system. This test ensures that we
can view that page for distributions that have series, and also those that
do not have series.

Some distributions have listings of major versions, for example Ubuntu:

    >>> anon_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/ubuntu')
    >>> print extract_text(find_portlet(
    ...         anon_browser.contents, 'Major current versions'))
    Major current versions
    ...Hoary...
    ...Warty...

Others do not have series:

    >>> anon_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/gentoo')
    >>> print find_portlet(anon_browser.contents, 'Major current versions')
    None
