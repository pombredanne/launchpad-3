  'name16' is an administrator of 'ubuntu-team', so he can manage this 
  team's contact email address. In this test 'name16' adds a new
  contact email address, validates it, then change it (having to
  validate the new one to) and finally removes the new contact
  email address.

register the same address at the same time. When this happens, the last one
to validate will get an error message saying that address is already
registered. 

Team sets a new contact email address.
