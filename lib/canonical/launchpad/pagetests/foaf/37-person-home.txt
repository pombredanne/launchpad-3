Personal Home Pages
===================

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import Person

Carlos can never see name12's email addresses: he has chosen not to disclose
them.

  >>> browser = setupBrowser(auth='Basic marilize@hbd.com:test')
  >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~name12')

  >>> name12 = Person.get(12)
  >>> name12.preferredemail.email
  u'test@canonical.com'
  >>> name12.hide_email_addresses
  True

  >>> str(name12.preferredemail.email) in browser.contents
  False

Mark has a registered email address, and he has chosen to disclose it to
the world.

  >>> mark = Person.get(1)
  >>> mark.preferredemail.email
  u'mark@hbd.com'
  >>> mark.hide_email_addresses
  False

If you are not logged in, you will not be able to see it:

  >>> anon_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~sabdfl')
  >>> str(mark.preferredemail.email) in anon_browser.contents
  False

If you log in, however, you will:

  >>> browser = setupBrowser(auth='Basic test@canonical.com:test')
  >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~sabdfl')
  >>> str(mark.preferredemail.email) in browser.contents
  True

A person's homepage also lists timezone, Karma and Ubuntero status
information:

  >>> print browser.contents
  <...
  <b>Timezone:</b>
  UTC
  ...
  <b>Ubuntero:</b>
  No
  ...
  <b>Karma:</b>
  <span id="karma-total">...

Launchpad creates profiles for people that have contributed to free software
(e.g. in a bug import or a translation template upload). It's clearly
stated that those people don't use Launchpad and why there's a profile for
them.

  >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~limi')
  >>> browser.title
  'Alexander Limi does not use Launchpad'

  >>> content = find_main_content(browser.contents).find('p')
  >>> print extract_text(content)
  Alexander Limi does not use Launchpad. This page was created on 2005-06-06
  when importing bugs from http://bugzilla.ubuntu.com/.


== Table of contributions ==

A person's home page also displays a table with the contributions made by that
person. This table includes 5 projects in which this person is most active
and also the areas in which (s)he worked on each project.

    >>> anon_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~name16')
    >>> table = find_tag_by_id(anon_browser.contents, 'contributions')
    >>> for tr in table.findAll('tr'):
    ...     print tr.find('th').find('a').renderContents()
    ...     for td in tr.findAll('td'):
    ...         img = td.find('img')
    ...         if img is not None:
    ...             print "\t", img['title']

If the person hasn't made any contributions, the table is not present in its
page.

    >>> anon_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~jdub')
    >>> print find_tag_by_id(anon_browser.contents, 'contributions')
    None

The same for teams.

    >>> anon_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~ubuntu-team')
    >>> print find_tag_by_id(anon_browser.contents, 'contributions')
    None
