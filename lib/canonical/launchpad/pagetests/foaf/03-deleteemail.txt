  'foo' doesn't want to use baz.foo@canonical.com on Launchpad. He removes it.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... POST /people/foo/+editemails HTTP/1.1
  ... Authorization: Basic Zm9vQGJhei5jb206Zg==
  ... Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
  ... 
  ... VALIDATED_SELECTED=baz.foo%40canonical.com&REMOVE_VALIDATED=Remove""")
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...
  ...The email address...has been removed...
  ...


  Now we check in the database to make sure that email is not there anymore.

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import EmailAddressSet
  >>> EmailAddressSet().getByEmail('baz.foo@canonical.com') is None
  True
