Start out by verifying the members page is sane.

  >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~ubuntu-team/+members')
  >>> 'Ubuntu Team' in browser.contents
  True
  >>> 'Mark Shuttleworth' in browser.contents
  True

Let's take a look at Colin's subscription page. Colin is an
administrator and his subscription never expires.

  >>> browser.addHeader('Authorization', 'Basic foo.bar@canonical.com:test')
  >>> browser.reload()
  >>> url = '/~ubuntu-team/+member/kamion'
  >>> browser.getLink(url=url).click()

  >>> "Colin Watson's membership status in Ubuntu Team" in browser.contents
  True
  >>> "Active member" in browser.contents
  True
  >>> browser.getControl(name='admin').value
  ['yes']

  >>> browser.getControl(name='expires').value
  ['never']

Post an incomplete date and remove his administrator status.

There is some TestBrowser voodoo at work here. The datepicker widget now
allows you to render it disabled, which is neat because in the compound
widget that we have made it shows more clearly when the date is relevant and
when it is not if we disable it when it is not relevant (when the expiration
is set to "Never" with the radio button).

The Zope TestBrowser is smart enough to detect that the widget was rendered
with the input disabled, but not smart enough to play out the JavaScript
which would enable the input when the radio button was clicked to indicate
that a specific expiration date was desired. There is also no TestBrowser
way to "enable" the input. So, we have to reach into the guts of the
TestBrowser to manually re-enable the input. That's what the
control.mech_control.disabled=False stuff is.

  >>> browser.getControl(name='admin').value = ['no']
  >>> browser.getControl(name='expires').value = ['date']
  >>> expiry = browser.getControl(name='membership.expirationdate')
  >>> expiry.mech_control.disabled = False # control may have been disabled
  >>> expiry.value = 'ssdf'
  >>> browser.getControl('Change').click()

We get a nice error message

  >>> for tag in find_tags_by_class(browser.contents, 'message'):
  ...     print tag.renderContents()
  Invalid expiration: Invalid date value

Give up on change, nothing should have changed with Colin:

  >>> from zope.component import getUtility
  >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import (
  ...     IPersonSet, ITeamMembershipSet)
  >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests import login, logout, ANONYMOUS
  >>> login(ANONYMOUS)
  >>> personset = getUtility(IPersonSet)
  >>> teammembershipset = getUtility(ITeamMembershipSet)
  >>> ubuntu_team = personset.getByName('ubuntu-team')
  >>> kamion = personset.getByName('kamion')
  >>> kamion_membership = teammembershipset.getByPersonAndTeam(
  ...     kamion, ubuntu_team)
  >>> kamion_membership.status.title
  'Administrator'
  >>> print kamion_membership.dateexpires
  None
  >>> logout()


Now revoke Colin's administrator status and make him expire in November
next year -- successfully.

  >>> from datetime import datetime, timedelta
  >>> expire_date = datetime.utcnow() + timedelta(days=365)

  >>> browser.getControl(name='admin').value = ['no']
  >>> browser.getControl(name='expires').value = ['date']
  >>> expiry = browser.getControl(name='membership.expirationdate')
  >>> expiry.mech_control.disabled = False # control may have been disabled
  >>> expiry.value = expire_date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
  >>> browser.getControl(name='comment').value = 'Arfie'
  >>> browser.getControl('Change').click()

We're redirected to the +members page

  >>> browser.url
  'http://launchpad.dev/~ubuntu-team/+members'

  >>> login(ANONYMOUS)
  >>> kamion_membership = teammembershipset.getByPersonAndTeam(
  ...     kamion, ubuntu_team)
  >>> kamion_membership.status.title
  'Approved'
  >>> kamion_membership.dateexpires.date() == expire_date.date()
  True
  >>> logout()

Now check Jeff's subscription. Jeff's also an administrator and his
subscription never expires, but he can demote himself.

  >>> jdub_browser = setupBrowser(auth='Basic jeff.waugh@ubuntulinux.com:jdub')
  >>> jdub_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~ubuntu-team/+members')
  >>> url = '/~ubuntu-team/+member/jdub' 
  >>> jdub_browser.getLink(url=url).click()

  >>> "Jeff Waugh's membership status in Ubuntu Team" in jdub_browser.contents
  True
  >>> "Active member" in jdub_browser.contents
  True

  >>> jdub_browser.getControl(name='admin').value = ['no']
  >>> jdub_browser.getControl('Change').click()

  >>> jdub_browser.url
  'http://launchpad.dev/~ubuntu-team/+members'

  >>> login(ANONYMOUS)
  >>> jdub = personset.getByName('jdub')
  >>> jdub_membership = teammembershipset.getByPersonAndTeam(
  ...     jdub, ubuntu_team)
  >>> jdub_membership.status.title
  'Approved'
  >>> logout()

Sample person had his membership declined to the guadamen group. Test
that the page works and that foo.bar@canonical can access it.

  >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~guadamen/+member/name12/')

  >>> 'Declined member' in browser.contents
  True

Dave Miller is a proposed member in Ubuntu Gnome Team.
If two people try to accept him as a member at the same time, the first one
should succeed and the second one receive a nice error message.

  >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~name18/+members')
  >>> url = '/~name18/+member/justdave'
  >>> browser.getLink(url=url).click()

  >>> second_browser = setupBrowser(auth='Basic foo.bar@canonical.com:test')
  >>> second_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev' + url)

Approve the membership in the first browser.

  >>> browser.getControl('Approve').click()

We're redirected to the members page.

  >>> browser.url
  'http://launchpad.dev/~name18/+members'

  >>> login(ANONYMOUS)
  >>> dave = personset.getByName('justdave')
  >>> ubuntu_gnome_team = personset.getByName('name18')
  >>> dave_membership = teammembershipset.getByPersonAndTeam(
  ...     dave, ubuntu_gnome_team)
  >>> dave_membership.status.title
  'Approved'
  >>> logout()


But in the second browser with the stale data we get an error message:

  >>> second_browser.getControl('Approve').click()
  >>> message = (
  ...     'The membership request for Dave Miller has already been processed')
  >>> message in second_browser.contents
  True


Team Participation page
=======================

The team participation page shows the team in which a person is a direct
member, as well as the teams in which they are an indirect member. We will
just make sure that this page is displaying without errors in several cases:

 - for a person with no memberships at all
 - for a person with direct memberships only
 - for a person with some indirect memberships
 - for a team with direct memberships only

First, Kiko has not joined any teams:

  >>> browser = setupBrowser()
  >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~kiko/+participation')
  >>> 'has not yet joined any teams' in browser.contents
  True
  >>> direct = find_portlet(browser.contents, 'Direct membership')
  >>> print direct
  None
  >>> indirect = find_portlet(browser.contents, 'Indirect membership')
  >>> print indirect
  None


Next, Alexander Limi is only a direct member:

  >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~limi/+participation')
  >>> 'has not yet joined any teams' in browser.contents
  False
  >>> print extract_text(find_portlet(browser.contents, 'Direct membership'))
  Direct membership
  Ubuntu Gnome Team
  Joined on ...
  Ubuntu Team
  Joined on ...
  >>> print find_portlet(browser.contents, 'Indirect membership')
  None


Next, Sample Person has both direct and indirect memberships:

  >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~name12/+participation')
  >>> 'has not yet joined any teams' in browser.contents
  False
  >>> direct = find_portlet(browser.contents, 'Direct membership')
  >>> 'Landscape Developers' in direct.renderContents()
  True
  >>> indirect = find_portlet(browser.contents, 'Indirect membership')
  >>> 'Ubuntu Gnome Team' in indirect.renderContents()
  True


The Ubuntu Team is only a direct member of other teams:

  >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~ubuntu-team/+participation')
  >>> 'has not yet joined any teams' in browser.contents
  False
  >>> direct = find_portlet(browser.contents, 'Direct membership')
  >>> 'GuadaMen' in direct.renderContents()
  True
  >>> indirect = find_portlet(browser.contents, 'Indirect membership')
  >>> print indirect
  None
