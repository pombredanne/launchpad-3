  Get the token we'll have to use to finish the registration process.

  >>> import email, re
  >>> from canonical.launchpad.mail import stub
  >>> from_addr, to_addrs, raw_msg = stub.test_emails.pop()
  >>> msg = email.message_from_string(raw_msg)

  >>> link = re.findall(r'http.*/token/.*', body)[0]
  >>> token = re.sub(r'.*token/', '', link)
  >>> base_path = '/token/%s' % token

  Check if the email was sent to the right address.

  >>> to_addrs
  ['guilherme.salgado@canonical.com']
