= Joining a moderated team =

Anybody can ask to join a moderated team, but the membership needs to be
approved by one of the team administrators.

  # Make 'myemail' a moderated team first.
  >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import PersonSet
  >>> from canonical.lp.dbschema import TeamSubscriptionPolicy
  >>> PersonSet().getByName('myemail').subscriptionpolicy = (
  ...     TeamSubscriptionPolicy.MODERATED)
  >>> from canonical.database.sqlbase import flush_database_updates
  >>> flush_database_updates()

  Workaround while https://launchpad.net/launchpad/+bug/39016 is not
  fixed.
  >>> from canonical.launchpad.mail import stub
  >>> stub.test_emails[:] = []

Now, 'myemail' is a MODERATED team, and 'salgado' will join again.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /~myemail/+join HTTP/1.1
  ... Authorization: Basic Z3VpbGhlcm1lLnNhbGdhZG9AY2Fub25pY2FsLmNvbTp6ZWNh
  ... """)

  Let's see if the team owner received an email notification that there's a
  new member waiting for approval. (this notification is sent to all team
  administrators, but in this case we don't have team administrators)

  >>> from_addr, to_addrs, raw_msg = stub.test_emails.pop()
  >>> assert not stub.test_emails
  >>> to_addrs
  ['foo@baz.com']
  >>> 'Reply-To: guilherme.salgado@canonical.com' in raw_msg
  True


  Proposed Members are not shown as "real" team members by our API.

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import Person, TeamMembership
  >>> salgado = Person.byName('salgado')
  >>> team = Person.byName('myemail')
  >>> tm = TeamMembership.selectOneBy(personID=salgado.id, teamID=team.id)
  >>> tm.statusname
  'Proposed'
  >>> salgado.inTeam(team)
  False
