= Launchpad's WADL caching =

Because Launchpad's main WADL files are so big, we cache them
internally: one WADL file for every version of the web service.
Because the WADL only changes when the Launchpad software changes,
these documents are cached to files.  Right now, the Launchpad
webservice serves a special test file
(canonical/launchpad/apidoc/wadl-testrunner-devel.xml) when a client
asks for the big WADL definition for the 'devel' version. The
'testrunner' part comes from canonical.config.config.instance_name, so
a development instance will use the file
canonical/launchpad/apidoc/wadl-development-{version}.xml.

    >>> test_wadl = webservice.get(
    ...     '/', 'application/vd.sun.wadl+xml', api_version='devel').body
    >>> print test_wadl
    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <wadl:application xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
                      xmlns="http://research.sun.com/wadl/2006/10"
                      xmlns:wadl="http://research.sun.com/wadl/2006/10"
                      xsi:schemaLocation="http://research.sun.com/wadl/2006/10/wadl.xsd">
    <BLANKLINE>
      <!--This file is for testing purposes only.  See
          canonical/launcpad/pagetests/webservice/xx-wadl.txt -->
    <BLANKLINE>
    </wadl:application>
    <BLANKLINE>

Let's look at the real contents, though.  To do this, we need to
deactivate the cache. Simply clearing it out will just cause it to be
filled up again.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.systemhomes import WebServiceApplication
    >>> old_cached_wadl = WebServiceApplication.cached_wadl
    >>> WebServiceApplication.cached_wadl = None

    >>> wadl = webservice.get(
    ...     '/', 'application/vd.sun.wadl+xml', api_version='devel').body
    >>> wadl = wadl.decode('UTF-8')

The real file is much bigger than the test file.

    >>> len(wadl) > len(test_wadl)
    True

The WADL we received is keyed to the 'devel' version of the web
service. This version will always be present.

    >>> 'http://api.launchpad.dev/devel/' in wadl
    True

If we retrieve the WADL for the '1.0' version of the web service,
we'll get a document keyed to the '1.0' version. The '1.0' version
will be deprecated along with the Lucid release of Ubuntu.

    >>> wadl_10 = webservice.get(
    ...     '/', 'application/vd.sun.wadl+xml', api_version='1.0').body
    >>> wadl_10 = wadl_10.decode('UTF-8')

    >>> 'http://api.launchpad.dev/1.0/' in wadl_10
    True

If we retrieve the WADL for the 'beta' version of the web service,
we'll get a document keyed to the 'beta' version. The '1.0' version
will be deprecated along with the Karmic release of Ubuntu.

    >>> wadl_beta = webservice.get(
    ...     '/', 'application/vd.sun.wadl+xml', api_version='beta').body
    >>> wadl_beta = wadl_beta.decode('UTF-8')

    >>> 'http://api.launchpad.dev/beta/' in wadl_beta
    True

We don't need the cache anymore, so we'll reinstate the testing
version. This way, other tests will have a clean slate.

    >>> WebServiceApplication.cached_wadl = old_cached_wadl

Like all lazr.restful applications, Launchpad's web service generates
valid WADL.

    >>> from lazr.restful import WADL_SCHEMA_FILE
    >>> from canonical.lazr.xml import XMLValidator
    >>> wadl_schema = XMLValidator(WADL_SCHEMA_FILE)

    # We need to replace the nbsp entity, because the validator
    # doesn't support embedded definition.
    >>> wadl_schema.validate(
    ...     wadl.replace('&nbsp;', '&#160;').encode('UTF-8'))
    True
