Some resources have binary files, usually images, associated with
them. These binary files are managed by the Launchpad library. The
Launchpad web service exposes these files as resources that respond to
GET, PUT, and DELETE.

The example used here is a person's mugshot.

Salgado starts out with a link to a mugshot, but no actual mugshot.

    >>> salgado = webservice.get('/beta/~salgado').jsonBody()
    >>> salgado['mugshot_link']
    u'http://api.launchpad.dev/beta/~salgado/mugshot'

    >>> salgado_mugshot = '/beta/~salgado/mugshot'
    >>> print webservice.get(salgado_mugshot)
    HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
    ...

We can upload a mugshot for salgado with PUT.

    >>> import os
    >>> import canonical
    >>> def load_image(filename):
    ...     image_file = os.path.join(
    ...         os.path.dirname(canonical.launchpad.__file__),
    ...         'images', filename)
    ...     return open(image_file).read()

    >>> print webservice.put(salgado_mugshot, 'image/png',
    ...                      load_image('nyet-mugshot.png'))
    HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
    ...

Once the mugshot has been uploaded, we can GET it. The resource acts
as a dispatcher pointing to the library-managed mugshot on the public
Internet.

    >>> print webservice.get(salgado_mugshot)
    HTTP/1.1 303 See Other
    ...
    Location: http://localhost:58000/90/mugshot


PUT is also used to modify a mugshot.

    >>> print webservice.put(salgado_mugshot, 'image/png',
    ...                      load_image('person-mugshot.png'))
    HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
    ...

The new mugshot is available at a different URL.

    >>> print webservice.get(salgado_mugshot)
    HTTP/1.1 303 See Other
    ...
    Location: http://localhost:58000/91/mugshot

Deleting a mugshot (with DELETE) disables the redirect.

    >>> print webservice.delete(salgado_mugshot)
    HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
    ...

    >>> print webservice.get(salgado_mugshot)
    HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
    ...

You can't upload an image that's the wrong type.

    >>> print webservice.put(salgado_mugshot, 'image/png', 'Not an image')
    HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
    ...
    The file uploaded was not recognized as an image; please check it
    and retry.

You also can't upload an image that's the wrong size.

    >>> print webservice.put(salgado_mugshot, 'image/png',
    ...                      load_image('nyet-icon.png'))
    HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
    ...
    This image is not exactly 192x192 pixels in size.
