The service root (/[version]/) is a resource that responds to GET by
describing the web service. The description is a JSON map full of
links to the top-level web service objects.

  # XXX leonardr 2008-04-24 bug=221037: This list includes top-level
  # collections from the Launchpad web service. This part of the
  # test can be simplified once the test is moved to another layer.
  >>> top_level_links = webservice.get("/beta/").jsonBody()
  >>> sorted(top_level_links.keys())
  [...u'BugCollection_collection_link', ...
   u'PersonSetCollectionAdapter_collection_link']
  >>> top_level_links['BugCollection_collection_link']
  u'http://api.launchpad.dev/beta/bugs'

The client can explore the entire web service by following these links
to other resources, and following the links served in those resources'
JSON representations, and so on. If the client doesn't know the
capabilities of a certain resource it can request a WADL
representation of that resource (see the xx-wadl.txt test) and find
out.

Though web services in general support all HTTP methods, this
particular resource supports only GET. Eventually it will also support
HEAD and OPTIONS.

  ...     print webservice("/beta/", method)
