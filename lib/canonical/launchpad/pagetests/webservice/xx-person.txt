= People =

Basic operations on people are described in xx-collections.txt. This
document shows some of the other features of a person.


== Team memberships ==

A person is linked to their team memberships.

  >>> salgado = webservice.get("/beta/~salgado").jsonBody()

  >>> salgado['team_memberships_collection_link']
  u'http://api.launchpad.dev/beta/~salgado/team_memberships'

Similarly, a team is linked to the team memberships of its members.

  >>> landscape_developers = webservice.get(
  ...     "/beta/~landscape-developers").jsonBody()
  >>> landscape_developers['member_memberships_collection_link']
  u'http://api.launchpad.dev/beta/~landscape-developers/member_memberships'

Team memberships are first-class objects with their own URLs.

  >>> salgado_memberships = sorted(webservice.get(
  ...     "/beta/~salgado/team_memberships").jsonBody()['entries'])
  >>> [m['self_link'] for m in salgado_memberships]
  [u'http://api.launchpad.dev/beta/~admins/+member/salgado',
   u'http://api.launchpad.dev/beta/~landscape-developers/+member/salgado']

Team memberships also have data fields.

  >>> salgado_landscape = salgado_memberships[1]
  >>> sorted(salgado_landscape)
  [u'date_expires', u'date_joined',
   u'last_change_comment', u'last_changed_by_link', u'member_link',
   u'self_link', u'status', u'team_link']

Each team membership links to the person who approved the link.

  >>> salgado_landscape['last_changed_by_link']
  u'http://api.launchpad.dev/beta/~name16'

Also to the person whose membership it is.

  >>> salgado_landscape['member_link']
  u'http://api.launchpad.dev/beta/~salgado'

Also to the team in which the membership is valid.

  >>> salgado_landscape['team_link']
  u'http://api.launchpad.dev/beta/~landscape-developers'

A TeamMembership relates a person to a team, and the relationship
works both ways. You've already seen how the representation of a
person includes a link to that person's team memberships. But it's
possible to navigate from a team, to the collection of peoples'
memberships in the team.

  >>> landscape_memberships = webservice.get(
  ...     "/beta/~landscape-developers/member_memberships").jsonBody()

  >>> [m['self_link'] for m in sorted(landscape_memberships['entries'])]
  [u'http://api.launchpad.dev/beta/~landscape-developers/+member/name12',
   u'http://api.launchpad.dev/beta/~landscape-developers/+member/salgado']

A list of team memberships is distinct from a list of a team's
members. Members are people; memberships are TeamMemberships. You've
seen the memberships for the 'landscape-developers' team above; here
are the members.

  >>> landscape_members = webservice.get(
  ...     "/beta/~landscape-developers/members").jsonBody()
  >>> [m['self_link'] for m in sorted(landscape_members['entries'])]
  [u'http://api.launchpad.dev/beta/~salgado',
   u'http://api.launchpad.dev/beta/~name12']
