  Let's search for some requests.

  First of all, let's see the requests that are still pending approval:

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /shipit-ubuntu/++vh++http:shipit.async.com.br:80/++/requests?statusfilter=pending&releasefilter=any&flavourfilter=any&orderby=daterequested&show=Show HTTP/1.1
  ... Authorization: Basic bWFyaWxpemVAaGJkLmNvbTp0ZXN0
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...
  ...Jeff Waugh...
  ...Marilize Coetzee...
  ...2...

  ...2 results...


  Now we search for approved requests containing Ubuntu CDs.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /shipit-ubuntu/++vh++http:shipit.async.com.br:80/++/requests?statusfilter=approved&releasefilter=any&flavourfilter=UBUNTU&orderby=daterequested&show=Show HTTP/1.1

  Now check the approved ones containing Kubuntu CDs.

  >>> print http(r"""

  We can also narrow our search based on someone's name or email address.

  Here we search for approved orders placed by someone whose name contains
  Kreutzmann.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /shipit-ubuntu/++vh++http:shipit.async.com.br:80/++/requests?recipient_text=Kreutzmann&statusfilter=approved&releasefilter=any&flavourfilter=any&orderby=daterequested&show=Show HTTP/1.1
  ... Authorization: Basic bWFyaWxpemVAaGJkLmNvbTp0ZXN0
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...
  ...Helge Kreutzmann...
  ...approved...
  ...1...
  ...of...
  ...1 result...
  ...


  And here we look for pending orders placed by Jeff Waugh.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /shipit-ubuntu/++vh++http:shipit.async.com.br:80/++/requests?recipient_text=waugh&statusfilter=pending&releasefilter=any&flavourfilter=any&orderby=daterequested&show=Show HTTP/1.1
