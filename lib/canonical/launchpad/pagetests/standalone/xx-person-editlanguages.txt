A person's +editlanguages page
------------------------------

Carlos is a translator who translates things into Spanish with Rosetta.
He is on Rosetta About page and wants to change his preferred languages.

  >>> browser.addHeader('Authorization', 'Basic carlos@canonical.com:test')
  >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/translations/+about')
  >>> browser.url
  'http://launchpad.dev/translations/+about'

So, he looks for the 'Select Languages...' link, and clicks on that which 
should take him to his +editlanguages page.

  >>> browser.getLink('Select Languages...').click()
  >>> browser.url
  'http://launchpad.dev/~carlos/+editlanguages'

So far, he has Spanish selected as one of his preferred languages, but not 
Welsh. 

  >>> browser.getControl('Spanish').selected
  True
  >>> browser.getControl('Welsh').selected
  False

Now let's suppose that Carlos decides that he doesn't like Spanish after all,
and that Welsh is a much nicer language. When he adjusts his preferences,
Spanish will no longer be selected, and Welsh will.

  >>> browser.getControl('Spanish').selected = False
  >>> browser.getControl('Welsh').selected = True
  >>> browser.getControl('Save').click()

After he submits the form, he should again be redirected back to Rosetta's
About page, and it should contain notices about the changes he made.

  # XXX: salgado 2006-11-21: This test is commented out because of
  # http://www.zope.org/Collectors/Zope3-dev/710
  >> browser.url
  'http://launchpad.dev/translations/+about'

  >>> print browser.contents
  <!DOCTYPE...
  ...Added Welsh to your preferred languages...
  ...Removed Spanish from your preferred languages...

And finally, lets revisit the +editlanguages page to check if the languages
have been properly selected.

  >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~carlos/+editlanguages')
  >>> browser.url
  'http://launchpad.dev/~carlos/+editlanguages'
  >>> browser.getControl('Spanish').selected
  False
  >>> browser.getControl('Welsh').selected
  True


When a user doesn't have a preferred language set, we determine it from the
user's browser headers. If his browser send us any non-utf8 encoded string in 
the Accept-Language header, we won't consider that as a valid language code.

We are also pretending that this request is coming from someone in
Serbia (194.247.192.33), to test country detection.  Proxies add
'X-Forwarded-For' header, which is what the code is handling.

  >>> from zope.testbrowser.testing import Browser
  >>> browser = Browser()
  >>> browser.addHeader('X-Forwarded-For', '194.247.192.33')
  >>> browser.addHeader('Authorization', 'Basic test@canonical.com:test')
  >>> browser.addHeader('Accept-Language', 'pt_br, Espa\xf1ol')
  >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~name12/+editlanguages')

  >>> from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup
  >>> def print_languages(rosetta_pref_page, portlet='preferred'):
  ...     """Print languages listed in the preferred or browser
  ...     languages portlet.
  ...
  ...     portlet keyword argument can be 'preferred' or 'browser'
  ...     """
  ...     soup = BeautifulSoup(rosetta_pref_page)
  ...     lang_portlet = soup.fetchText(
  ...         'Your %s languages' % portlet)[0].parent.parent
  ...     for lang in lang_portlet('li', {'class': 'languages'}):
  ...         print lang.string

  >>> print_languages(browser.contents, portlet='browser')
  Portuguese (Brazil)

Now we are checking that the country is properly detected.  Since we
don't have data for languages spoken in Serbia, we get information
about how to contact Rosetta Admins to update it.

  >>> country_portlet = find_portlet(browser.contents,
  ...     'Languages in Serbia and Montenegro')
  >>> print country_portlet.find('li', 'languages')
  None
  >>> print country_portlet.first('a')['href']
  mailto:rosetta@launchpad.net

We also have a page under the launchpad root, called +editmylanguages, with
launchpad.AnyPerson as permission. This is the page to which we direct
non-logged in users to edit their preferred languages.

  >>> anon_browser.handleErrors = True
  >>> anon_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/+editmylanguages')
  >>> anon_browser.url
  'http://launchpad.dev/+editmylanguages/+login'

  >>> anon_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/+editmylanguages/+login')
  >>> anon_browser.getControl('E-mail address:', index=0).value = (
  ...     'no-priv@canonical.com')
  >>> anon_browser.getControl('Password:').value = 'test'
  >>> anon_browser.getControl(name='loginpage_submit_login').click()
  >>> anon_browser.url
  'http://launchpad.dev/~no-priv/+editlanguages'


For backwards compatibility we keep do a redirect from the old /rosetta/prefs
page to the new one. Note that this is a permanent redirect, since the old
page has been deprecated.
