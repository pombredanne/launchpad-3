= Redirecting users after the registration process =

We want to be nice with your users (the new ones, at least ;) and redirect
them to any page they were trying to access before they were asked to create
the new account.

The most important case for us is when people get a file-bug URL from apport
on an Ubuntu system. When this happens we need to make sure they're
redirected to exactly the same URL they got from apport.

Let's say Granny was playing around with Evolution (everybody's #1 MUA) and
it crashed. Apport then gave her the following URL (which she promptly
clicked): http://launchpad.dev/firefox/+filebug/121212

    >>> anon_browser.handleErrors = True
    >>> anon_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/firefox/+filebug/121212')
    >>> anon_browser.url
    'http://launchpad.dev/firefox/+filebug/121212/+login'

    >>> anon_browser.getControl(name='redirection_url').value
    'http://launchpad.dev/firefox/+filebug/121212'


Similarly, if she wants to join a launchpad team, we'll try hard to redirect
them back to that same team, after the registration is complete.

    >>> anon_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~ubuntu-team/+join')
    >>> anon_browser.url
    'http://launchpad.dev/%7Eubuntu-team/+join/+login'

    >>> anon_browser.getControl(name='redirection_url').value
    'http://launchpad.dev/%7Eubuntu-team/+join'

    # Clean up stub.test_emails to make sure other tests don't fuck us over.
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.mail import stub
    >>> stub.test_emails = []


If she now creates a new account, we'll certainly redirect her back to
whatever we had stored on the redirection_url hidden field.

    >>> anon_browser.getControl('E-mail address:', index=1).value = (
    ...     'granny@canonical.com')
    >>> anon_browser.getControl('Register').click()
    >>> print anon_browser.contents
    <...
    <h1>Registration mail sent</h1>
    ...

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests.logintoken import (
    ...     get_token_url_from_email)
    >>> from_addr, to_addr, msg = stub.test_emails.pop()
    >>> url = get_token_url_from_email(msg)
    >>> anon_browser.open(url)

    >>> anon_browser.getControl('Display Name').value = 'Granny'
    >>> anon_browser.getControl(name='field.password').value = 'foo'
    >>> anon_browser.getControl(name='field.password_dupe').value = 'foo'
    >>> anon_browser.getControl('Continue').click()

    >>> anon_browser.url
    'http://launchpad.dev/%7Eubuntu-team/+join'
