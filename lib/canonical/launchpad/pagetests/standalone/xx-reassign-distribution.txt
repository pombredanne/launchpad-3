  Let's change the owner of the ubuntu distribution.


  Sample Person logs in and try to change the owner, but he can't because he's
  not the distro owner nor a member of Launchpad admins.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /distros/ubuntu/+reassign HTTP/1.1
  ... Authorization: Basic dGVzdEBjYW5vbmljYWwuY29tOnRlc3Q=
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
  Content-Length: ...
  Content-Type: text/html;charset=utf-8
  ...


  Now we're logged in as Mark Shuttleworth, and he's a member of the team that
  is the distro owner. He tries to make salgado the new distro owner, but 
  salgado hasn't validated his email address yet, so he can't be the distro 
  owner.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... POST /distros/ubuntu/+reassign HTTP/1.1
  ... Authorization: Basic bWFya0BoYmQuY29tOnRlc3Q=
  ...
  ... field.owner=salgado&existing=existing&CHANGE_OWNER=Change+Owner""")
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  Content-Length: ...
  Content-Type: text/html;charset=utf-8
  ...
  ...The person/team named 'salgado' is not a valid owner...
  ...


  Now Mark reassigns the distro to himself.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... POST /distros/ubuntu/+reassign HTTP/1.1
  ... Authorization: Basic bWFya0BoYmQuY29tOnRlc3Q=
  ... field.owner=sabdfl&existing=existing&CHANGE_OWNER=Change+Owner""")
  HTTP/1.1 303 See Other
  ...
  Location: .
  ...


  Mark is now displayed as the owner.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /distros/ubuntu/ HTTP/1.1
  ... Authorization: Basic bWFya0BoYmQuY29tOnRlc3Q=
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  Content-Length: ...
  Content-Type: text/html;charset=utf-8
  ...
  ...Admin:...
  ...
  ...Mark Shuttleworth...
  ...


  Now Mark tries to reassign the distro to a new team called salgado, but he
  can't because there's already a user called salgado.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... POST /distros/ubuntu/+reassign HTTP/1.1
  ... Authorization: Basic bWFya0BoYmQuY29tOnRlc3Q=
  ... Content-Length: ...
  ... Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
  ... 
  ... field.owner=salgado&existing=new&CHANGE_OWNER=Change+Owner""")
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  Content-Length: ...
  Content-Type: text/html;charset=utf-8
  ...
  ...There's already a person/team with the name 'salgado' in Launchpad...
  ...
