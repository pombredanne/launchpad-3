We want to be able to edit the ubuntu packaging for a product series, and we
also want to be able to create it where there was none previously.

first, make sure we can see a page for this on the trunk series of
evolution.  The form field shows that it is currently mapped to evolution.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /evolution/trunk/+ubuntupkg HTTP/1.1
  ... Authorization: Basic Y2FybG9zQGNhbm9uaWNhbC5jb206dGVzdA==
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...
        <h1>Ubuntu packaging</h1>
  ...
      <form method="POST"
            action="http://localhost:9000/evolution/trunk/+ubuntupkg">
  ...
            <input type="text" name="ubuntupkg" size="30"
                   value="evolution" />
  ...


Now let's POST to that form, we'll say we are linking it to package pmount,
which is clearly not correct! In the resulting page, you can see that the
form now says pmount, and there is a new row in the history that includes
it.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... POST /evolution/trunk/+ubuntupkg HTTP/1.1
  ... Content-Length: 36
  ... Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
  ... Authorization: Basic Y2FybG9zQGNhbm9uaWNhbC5jb206dGVzdA==
  ... 
  ... ubuntupkg=pmount&set_ubuntu_pkg=Update""")
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  Content-Length: ...
  Content-Type: text/html;charset=utf-8
  <BLANKLINE>
  ...
            <input type="text" name="ubuntupkg" size="30"
                   value="pmount" />
  ...


OK, if that worked, we better set it back to where it was so we restore balance to the Force...

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... POST /evolution/trunk/+ubuntupkg HTTP/1.1
  ... Content-Length: 39
  ... Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
  ... Authorization: Basic Y2FybG9zQGNhbm9uaWNhbC5jb206dGVzdA==
  ... 
  ... ubuntupkg=evolution&set_ubuntu_pkg=Update""")
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  Content-Length: ...
  Content-Type: text/html;charset=utf-8
  <BLANKLINE>
  ...
            <input type="text" name="ubuntupkg" size="30"
                   value="evolution" />
  ...


Now lets make sure we can create a new ubuntu package relationship where
none existed previously. First make sure none exists, by viewing the form,
it should have an empty field for ubuntupkg.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /thunderbird/trunk/+ubuntupkg HTTP/1.1
  ... Authorization: Basic Y2FybG9zQGNhbm9uaWNhbC5jb206dGVzdA==
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  Content-Length: ...
  Content-Type: text/html;charset=utf-8
  <BLANKLINE>
  ...
            <input type="text" name="ubuntupkg" size="30"
                   value="" />
  ...


Trying to add a Source Package with an non-existent name should fail graciously.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... POST /thunderbird/trunk/+ubuntupkg HTTP/1.1
  ... Authorization: Basic Y2FybG9zQGNhbm9uaWNhbC5jb206dGVzdA==
  ... Content-Length: 37
  ... Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
  ... 
  ... ubuntupkg=moz&set_ubuntu_pkg=Update""")
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...
  ...<div class="error message">Invalid source package name moz</div>...
  ...
            <input type="text" name="ubuntupkg" size="30"
                   value="" />
  ...


Now let's post to it. We'll lie and say it's the mozilla source package in
the current ubuntu distroseries.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... POST /thunderbird/trunk/+ubuntupkg HTTP/1.1
  ... Authorization: Basic Y2FybG9zQGNhbm9uaWNhbC5jb206dGVzdA==
  ... Content-Length: 37
  ... Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
  ... 
  ... ubuntupkg=mozilla&set_ubuntu_pkg=Update""")
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  Content-Length: ...
  Content-Type: text/html;charset=utf-8
  <BLANKLINE>
  ...
            <input type="text" name="ubuntupkg" size="30"
                   value="mozilla" />
  ...
