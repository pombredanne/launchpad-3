Ticket Subscriptions
====================

The ticket page should show a "Subscribe" link.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /products/firefox/+ticket/2/ HTTP/1.1
  ... Authorization: Basic Zm9vLmJhckBjYW5vbmljYWwuY29tOnRlc3Q=
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...Subscribe...

The ticket should have a +subscribe page, which should have a heading
inviting you to subscribe and a form submit button to do so.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /products/firefox/+ticket/2/+subscribe HTTP/1.1
  ... Authorization: Basic Zm9vLmJhckBjYW5vbmljYWwuY29tOnRlc3Q=
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...Subscribe to Ticket...
  <input type="submit" name="subscribe"...value="Subscribe" />...

POSTing that form back to the ticket page should show a portal message
saying you have subscribed, and also list Foo Bar in the subscribers
portlet, and finally change the link to "Unsubscribe".

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... POST /products/firefox/+ticket/2/ HTTP/1.1
  ... Authorization: Basic Zm9vLmJhckBjYW5vbmljYWwuY29tOnRlc3Q=
  ... Content-Length: 19
  ... Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
  ... 
  ... subscribe=Subscribe""")
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...You have subscribed to this ticket...
  ...+subscribe">Unsubscribe</a>...
  ...Subscribers to Ticket #2:...
  ...Foo Bar...

The +subscribe page should now talk about "Unsubscribing".

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /products/firefox/+ticket/2/+subscribe HTTP/1.1
  ... Authorization: Basic Zm9vLmJhckBjYW5vbmljYWwuY29tOnRlc3Q=
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...Unsubscribe From Ticket...
  <input type="submit" name="subscribe"...value="Unsubscribe" />...

And POSTing it to the ticket page should unsubscribe the user from this
ticket.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... POST /products/firefox/+ticket/2/ HTTP/1.1
  ... Authorization: Basic Zm9vLmJhckBjYW5vbmljYWwuY29tOnRlc3Q=
  ... Content-Length: 21
  ... Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
  ... 
  ... subscribe=Unsubscribe""")
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...You have unsubscribed from this ticket...
  ...+subscribe">Subscribe</a>...
