We should be able to see the workload of a sprint:

  >>> anon_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/sprints/ubz/+assignments')
  >>> anon_browser.title
  'Blueprint assignments for Ubuntu Below Zero'

We should be able to see the spec assignment table of a sprint:

  >>> from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup
  >>> [soup] = BeautifulSoup(anon_browser.contents)('div', id='mainarea')
  >>> [tag.string for tag in soup('tr')[0]('th')]
  [u'Priority', u'Name', u'Definition', u'Delivery', u'Assignee', u'Drafter',
   u'Approver']

And we should be able to see the workload page of a sprint even when there's
no spec assigned to people.

  >>> anon_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/sprints/ltsponsteroids/+assignments')
  >>> 'No blueprints to display' in anon_browser.contents
  True
