Launchpad Sprint Tracker
========================

Launchpad lets us register a meeting, and then keep track of which specs are
due to be discussed at that meeting. As a result we can schedule and
prioritise BOF's at the meeting, using an as-yet-undeveloped
schedul-o-matic.

Let's start by viewing the list of sprints registered.

  >>> user_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/sprints')
  >>> user_browser.title
  'Meetings and sprints registered in Launchpad'

  >>> from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup
  >>> soup = BeautifulSoup(user_browser.contents)
  >>> print soup('p')[0].string
  You can register a sprint or a meeting in Launchpad, and then keep track
  of the specifications that will be discussed at that meeting.

Now lets have a look at one sprint in particular. We expect to have UBZ in
the sample data:

  >>> user_browser.getLink('Ubuntu Below Zero').click()
  >>> user_browser.url
  'http://launchpad.dev/sprints/ubz'
