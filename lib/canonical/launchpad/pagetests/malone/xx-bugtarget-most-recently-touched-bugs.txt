= Most recently touched bugs portlet =

For each IBugTarget there's a portlet available for showing the most
recently updated bugs. It's shown on the following pages:

== Product page ==

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests.test_pages import find_portlet
    >>> anon_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/products/firefox')
    >>> portlet = find_portlet(anon_browser.contents, 'Latest bugs reported')
    >>> for tr in portlet('tr'):
    ...   icon_td, summary_td = tr('td')
    ...   for tag in summary_td.findAll():
    ...       print tag.renderContents()
