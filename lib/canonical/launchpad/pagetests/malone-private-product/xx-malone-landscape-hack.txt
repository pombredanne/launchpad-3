Because the Landscape project is not public, a special hack was added to
*force all bugs filed on Landscape to be private*.

(A more elaborate solution involving a flag on the product was rejected
for now, due to concerns of overengineering a solution for a problem
we've only seen once.)

The Landscape product is a celebrity.

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests import login, logout
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import ILaunchpadCelebrities
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IProductSet

    >>> login("foo.bar@canonical.com")

    >>> celebs = getUtility(ILaunchpadCelebrities)
    >>> landscape = getUtility(IProductSet).getByName("landscape")
    >>> celebs.landscape == landscape
    True

A bug filed on Landscape is always forced to be private. (We will
demonstrate using the advanced filebug form, to skip searching for
dupes.)

    >>> from zope.testbrowser.testing import Browser

    >>> list(landscape.all_bugtasks)
    []

    >>> logout()

    >>> browser = Browser()
    >>> browser.handleErrors = False

    >>> browser.addHeader("Authorization", "Basic foo.bar@canonical.com:test")

    >>> browser.open(
    ...     "http://launchpad.dev/landscape/+filebug-advanced")

    >>> browser.getControl(name="field.title").value = "a test summary"
    >>> browser.getControl(name="field.comment").value = (
    ...     "a test description")
    >>> browser.getControl("Submit Bug Report").click()

    >>> login("foo.bar@canonical.com")

    >>> landscape_bugtask = landscape.all_bugtasks[0]

    >>> landscape_bugtask.bug.private
    True

But not forced to be security-related, of course.

    >>> landscape_bugtask.bug.security_related
    False

Additionally, the bug contact is subscribed.

    >>> landscape.bugcontact.name
    u'landscape-developers'

    >>> sorted(sub.name for sub in landscape_bugtask.bug.getDirectSubscribers())
    [u'landscape-developers', u'name16']

    >>> logout()
