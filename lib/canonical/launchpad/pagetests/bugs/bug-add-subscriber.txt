Non-Personal Subscriptions
==========================

In addition to subscribing / unsubscribing yourself, it is possible to add a
person as a subscriber to the bug. You would use this feature to subscribe
someone else to the bug.

Anonymous users should not be able to subscribe someone else to a bug.

    >>> anon_browser.open('http://bugs.launchpad.dev/firefox/+bug/1')
    >>> anon_browser.getLink('Subscribe someone else').click()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    Unauthorized: ...

No Privileges wants to subscribe David Allouche to the bug because he knows
that he's interested in that feature.

    >>> user_browser.open('http://bugs.launchpad.dev/firefox/+bug/1')
    >>> user_browser.getLink('Subscribe someone else').click()
    >>> user_browser.url
    'http://bugs.launchpad.dev/firefox/+bug/1/+addsubscriber'

If No Privileges has a sudden change of heart, there's a cancel link
that will return the browser to the bug page.

    >>> cancel_link = user_browser.getLink('Cancel')
    >>> cancel_link.url
    'http://bugs.launchpad.dev/firefox/+bug/1'

By looking at the 'Subscribers' portlet, he sees that David Allouche is not
currently subscribed to the bug:

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests.bug import (
    ...     print_direct_subscribers, print_indirect_subscribers)

    >>> user_browser.open(
    ...     'http://bugs.launchpad.dev/bugs/1/'
    ...     '+bug-portlet-subscribers-content')
    >>> print_direct_subscribers(user_browser.contents)
    Sample Person (Subscribed by Launchpad Janitor)
    Steve Alexander (Subscribed by Launchpad Janitor)
    >>> print_indirect_subscribers(user_browser.contents)
    From duplicates:
    Also notified:
    Foo Bar
    Mark Shuttleworth
    Ubuntu Team

    >>> user_browser.open('http://bugs.launchpad.dev/firefox/+bug/1/+addsubscriber')

Unlike the main bug page, here the 'Subscribers' portlet does not have
any 'Subscribe' links.

    >>> user_browser.getLink('Subscribe')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    LinkNotFoundError

He subscribes David Allouche to the bug using his Launchpad username.

    >>> user_browser.getControl("Person").value = 'ddaa'
    >>> user_browser.getControl("Add").click()
    >>> user_browser.url
    'http://bugs.launchpad.dev/firefox/+bug/1'

He is notified that David Allouche has been subscribed.

    >>> for tag in find_tags_by_class(user_browser.contents,
    ...     'informational message'):
    ...     extract_text(tag)
    u'David Allouche has been subscribed to this bug.'

The subscribers portlet now contains the new subscriber's name.

    >>> user_browser.open(
    ...     'http://bugs.launchpad.dev/bugs/1/'
    ...     '+bug-portlet-subscribers-content')
    >>> print_direct_subscribers(user_browser.contents)
    David Allouche (Subscribed by No Privileges Person)
    Sample Person (Subscribed by Launchpad Janitor)
    Steve Alexander (Subscribed by Launchpad Janitor)
