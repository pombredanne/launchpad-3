= Showing a duplicate of a private bug =

When showing a duplicate of a private bug, the title of the private
bug is not included in the page if the user does not have permission
to view the private bug.

First we mark a bug as private:

    >>> admin_browser.open(
    ...     'http://bugs.launchpad.dev/'
    ...         'debian/+source/mozilla-firefox/+bug/8/+secrecy')
    >>> admin_browser.getControl(
    ...     'This bug report should be private').selected = True
    >>> admin_browser.getControl('Change').click()
    >>> print admin_browser.url
    http://bugs.launchpad.dev/debian/+source/mozilla-firefox/+bug/8

    >>> print admin_browser.title
    Bug #8 ...Printing doesn't work...

    >>> print find_tag_by_id(
    ...     admin_browser.contents, 'bug-properties').img['title']
    This bug report was made private by Foo Bar ... ago

Next we mark another bug as a duplicate of the private bug:

    >>> admin_browser.open(
    ...     'http://bugs.launchpad.dev/'
    ...         'ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.15/+bug/10/+duplicate')
    >>> admin_browser.getControl('Duplicate Of').value = '8'
    >>> admin_browser.getControl('Change').click()

As a privileged user the title of the private bug can be found in the
duplicate bug page:

    >>> def print_messages(browser):
    ...     for tag in find_tags_by_class(browser.contents, 'message'):
    ...         print tag.renderContents()

    >>> print_messages(admin_browser)
    This report is a duplicate of
      <a href="/bugs/8" title="Printing doesn't work">bug #8</a>
    Remember, this bug report is a duplicate. Comment here only if you
    think the duplicate status is wrong.

But when accessing it as an unprivileged user the title of the private
bug cannot be found in the messages on the duplicate bug page:

    >>> user_browser.open(admin_browser.url)
    >>> print_messages(user_browser)
    This report is a duplicate of bug #8
    Remember, this bug report is a duplicate. Comment here only if you
    think the duplicate status is wrong.

The same is true when viewing the duplicate bug anonymously:

    >>> anon_browser.open(admin_browser.url)
    >>> print_messages(anon_browser)
    This report is a duplicate of bug #8
