== Distribution Packaging ==

The packaging records for a source package in a given distribution are
displayed on the page of the distribution source package.

    >>> anon_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/ubuntu/+source/alsa-utils')

This page includes a table that lists all the releases of this source
package in this distribution, and the packaging associations for this
source package in each series of this distribution.

When there are multiple releases for a package in a given distribution
series, most columns are not duplicated.

=== Delete Link Button ===

A button is displayed to authenticated users to delete existing

    >>> print form.getControl("Delete Link")
    <SubmitControl name='field.actions.delete_packaging' type='submit'>

This button is not displayed to anonymous users.

    >>> print extract_text(find_tag_by_id(content, 'packaging'))
    Ubuntu version                  Upstream version
    hoary   development   release   1.0.9a-4ubuntu1   None defined

The packaging association is persistently deleted. It does not reappear
if the page is reloaded.

XXX: if the incorrect behaviour does occur, user_browser.reload() does
not expose it, but user_browse.open() does. -- David Allouche 2007-12-02
