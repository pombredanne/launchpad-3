= Launchpad Single-Signon Workflow: Registration =

If a user wants to use a Launchpad-SSO web site, but does not have a
Launchpad account, they can register directly from the login page.

First we will set up the helper view that lets us test the final
portion of the authentication process:

    >>> from openid.consumer.consumer import Consumer
    >>> from openid.consumer.discover import OPENID_1_1_TYPE
    >>> from openid.fetchers import setDefaultFetcher
    >>> from openid.sreg import SRegRequest, SRegResponse
    >>> from openid.store.memstore import MemoryStore
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests.openidhelpers import (
    ...     complete_from_browser, install_consumer,
    ...     make_identifier_select_endpoint, uninstall_consumer,
    ...     PublisherFetcher)
    >>> install_consumer()
    >>> setDefaultFetcher(PublisherFetcher())

The authentication process is started by the relying party issuing a
checkid_setup request, sending the user to Launchpad:

    >>> openid_store = MemoryStore()
    >>> consumer = Consumer(session={}, store=openid_store)

    >>> request = consumer.beginWithoutDiscovery(
    ...     make_identifier_select_endpoint(OPENID_1_1_TYPE))
    >>> browser.open(request.redirectURL(
    ...     'http://launchpad.dev/', 'http://launchpad.dev/+openid-consumer'))

When a new account is created we'll use the creation rationale specified for
the trust_root given by the relying party.  We will set up an RP
configuration that uses the UBUNTU_SHOP creation rationale:

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests import ANONYMOUS, login, logout
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import (
    ...     IOpenIDRPConfigSet, IPersonSet, PersonCreationRationale)

    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')
    >>> rpconfig = getUtility(IOpenIDRPConfigSet).new(
    ...     trust_root='http://launchpad.dev/',
    ...     displayname='The Ubuntu Store from Canonical',
    ...     description="For the Ubuntu Store, you need a Launchpad account "
    ...                 "so  we can remember your order details and keep in "
    ...                 "touch with you about your orders.",
    ...     creation_rationale=PersonCreationRationale.OWNER_CREATED_UBUNTU_SHOP)
    >>> logout()

At this point, we are at the login page.  Lets try to create a new
account for an email address that has already been registered:

    >>> print browser.title
    Launchpad Login Service
    >>> browser.getControl(name='field.email').value = 'test@canonical.com'
    >>> browser.getControl('No, I want to create an account now').click()
    >>> browser.getControl('Continue').click()

    >>> print browser.title
    Launchpad Login Service
    >>> for tag in find_tags_by_class(browser.contents, 'error'):
    ...     print extract_text(tag)
    Sorry, someone has already registered the test@canonical.com email
    address.  If this is you and you've forgotten your password,
    just choose the 'I've forgotten my password' option below and
    we'll allow you to change it.

If we instead pick a new email address, we can register an account:

    >>> browser.getControl(name='field.email').value = 'new-user@example.com'
    >>> browser.getControl('Continue').click()
    >>> soup = find_main_content(browser.contents)
    >>> print soup.find('h1').renderContents()
    Registration mail sent

The user would then check their email, and find a message:

    >>> import email, re
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.mail import stub
    >>> from_addr, to_addrs, raw_msg = stub.test_emails.pop()
    >>> len(stub.test_emails)
    0
    >>> msg = email.message_from_string(raw_msg)
    >>> print from_addr
    bounces@canonical.com
    >>> print to_addrs
    ['new-user@example.com']
    >>> print msg.get_payload(decode=True) #doctest: -NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    Hello
    <BLANKLINE>
    Thank you for registering with the Launchpad Login Service.
    <BLANKLINE>
    To complete your registration:
    <BLANKLINE>
        http://openid.launchpad.dev/token/...
    <BLANKLINE>
    If you don't know what this is about, then someone has probably
    entered your e-mail address by mistake at the Launchpad Login Service
    Web site. Sorry about that. You don't need to do anything further,
    just delete this message.
    <BLANKLINE>
    Regards,
    The Launchpad Login Service team
    <BLANKLINE>

Let's extract the URL from the email and follow the link:

    >>> link = re.findall(r'http.*/token/.*', msg.get_payload())[0]
    >>> browser.open(link)
    >>> print browser.url
    http://openid.launchpad.dev/token/.../+newaccount

The user can enter their full name and password, to complete the
registration:

    >>> browser.getControl('Name').value = 'New User'
    >>> browser.getControl('Password').value = 'test'
    >>> browser.getControl(name='field.password_dupe').value = 'test'
    >>> browser.getControl('Continue').click()

Now the user is logged in with their new account, and has been
directed back to the original site:

    >>> print browser.url
    http://launchpad.dev/+openid-consumer?...
    >>> print browser.contents
    Consumer received GET
    ...

The creation rationale has been set correctly:

    >>> login(ANONYMOUS)
    >>> person = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByEmail('new-user@example.com')
    >>> expected_claimed_id = (
    ...     'http://openid.launchpad.dev/+id/' + person.openid_identifier)
    >>> print person.creation_rationale.name
    OWNER_CREATED_UBUNTU_SHOP
    >>> logout()

And the response matches the new OpenID:

    >>> info = complete_from_browser(consumer, browser, expected_claimed_id)
    >>> print info.status
    success
    >>> info.identity_url == expected_claimed_id
    True


== Cleanup ==

    >>> setDefaultFetcher(None)
    >>> uninstall_consumer()
