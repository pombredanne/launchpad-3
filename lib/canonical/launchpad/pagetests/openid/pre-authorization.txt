= Pre-authorized consumers =

In some cases we want consumers to be pre-authorized so that the
authorization step of the protocol is skipped.  This is the case for
canonical's training site: we want the canonical shop to pre-authorize
the training site when a user buys some sort of training.

To do so the shop has to craft a link which takes the user to the
training site through Launchpad.  This is what the link looks like:

    https://openid.launchpad.net/+pre-authorize-rp?trust_root=...&callback=...

Where the value of trust_root should be the root URL of the consumer to
be pre-authorized and callback is the URL to which the user will be
redirected after the consumer is pre-authorized.

As an example we'll pre-authorize our own OpenID consumer:

    >>> from urllib import urlencode
    >>> args = urlencode({
    ...     'trust_root': 'http://launchpad.dev/',
    ...     'callback': 'http://launchpad.dev/people/+me'})
    >>> browser.handleErrors = True
    >>> browser.open(
    ...     'http://openid.launchpad.dev/+pre-authorize-rp?%s' % args)

    # Since the user is not logged in, he'll have to login first.
    >>> browser.title
    'Log in or register with Launchpad'
    >>> browser.getControl('E-mail address:', index=0).value = 'mark@hbd.com'
    >>> browser.getControl('Password:').value = 'test'
    >>> browser.getControl('Log In').click()

    # Now he's redirected to the callback page and the RP has been
    # pre-authorized.
    >>> browser.url
    'http://launchpad.dev/~sabdfl'

From now on, and until that authorization expires, the user won't need
to authorize that consumer when he wants to log into it.

    # First we will set up the helper view that lets us test the OpenID
    # protocol.
    >>> from openid.consumer.discover import OPENID_2_0_TYPE
    >>> from openid.consumer.consumer import Consumer
    >>> from openid.fetchers import setDefaultFetcher
    >>> from openid.store.memstore import MemoryStore
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.testing.openidhelpers import (
    ...     make_identifier_select_endpoint, PublisherFetcher)
    >>> setDefaultFetcher(PublisherFetcher())

    # The authentication process is started by the relying party issuing a
    # checkid_setup request, sending the user to Launchpad.
    >>> openid_store = MemoryStore()
    >>> consumer = Consumer(session={}, store=openid_store)
    >>> request = consumer.beginWithoutDiscovery(
    ...     make_identifier_select_endpoint(OPENID_2_0_TYPE))
    >>> browser.open(request.redirectURL(
    ...     'http://launchpad.dev/', 'http://launchpad.dev/+openid-consumer'))

The user (sabdfl) was already logged into Launchpad, so at this point,
instead of being presented with a form asking if they want to 
authenticate to the relying party, they are sent directly to the RP.

    >>> print browser.url
    http://launchpad.dev/+openid-consumer?...

If the HTTP referrer and the trust_root are not in our config's
openid_preauthorization_acl, we will not pre-authorize.

    >>> from canonical.config import config
    >>> print config.launchpad.openid_preauthorization_acl
    localhost http://launchpad.dev/

    >>> browser = setupBrowser(auth="Basic test@canonical.com:test")
    >>> browser.addHeader('Referer', 'http://www.example.com')
    >>> browser.open(
    ...     'http://openid.launchpad.dev/+pre-authorize-rp?%s' % args)
    >>> browser.open(request.redirectURL(
    ...     'http://launchpad.dev/', 'http://launchpad.dev/+openid-consumer'))
    >>> print browser.title
    Authenticate to http://launchpad.dev/

    >>> browser = setupBrowser(auth="Basic test@canonical.com:test")
    >>> args = urlencode({
    ...     'trust_root': 'http://example.com/',
    ...     'callback': 'http://launchpad.dev/people/+me'})
    >>> browser.open(
    ...     'http://openid.launchpad.dev/+pre-authorize-rp?%s' % args)
    >>> browser.open(request.redirectURL(
    ...     'http://example.com/', 'http://example.com/+openid-consumer'))
    >>> print browser.title
    Authenticate to http://example.com/
