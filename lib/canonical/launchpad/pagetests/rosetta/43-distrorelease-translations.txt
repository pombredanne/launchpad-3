First, we need to ensure that we can see the distrorelease translations
page, and that it has all the data we are expecting, in terms of languages.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /distros/ubuntu/hoary/+translations HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  Content-Length: ...
  Content-Type: text/html;charset=utf-8
  <BLANKLINE>
  ...
  ...<h1>Translation status by language</h1>...
  ...Catalan...
  ...Xhosa...
  ...

We also should see any personal language that is not already translated, but
which is in the personal pref list. In this example, we tell the system that
our browser speaks Afrihili, and since the user is anonymous the system will
put Afrihili into the list of "preferred languages".

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /distros/ubuntu/hoary/+translations HTTP/1.1
  ... Accept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.7,afh;q=0.3
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  Content-Length: ...
  Content-Type: text/html;charset=utf-8
  <BLANKLINE>
  ...
  ...<h1>Translation status by language</h1>...
  ...Afrihili...
  ...

If we select Croatian, we would expect to see the list of source package
templates, and in the sample data we should have a croatian pofile for
pmount. Note that we should also have an empty pofile (really a dummy
pofile) for evolution-2.2

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /distros/ubuntu/hoary/+lang/hr HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...Croatian...
  ...Programs you can translate...
  ...evolution-2.2...
  ...22...
  ...pkgconf-mozilla...
  ...9...
  ...pmount...
  ...63...
  ...Edgar Bursic...
