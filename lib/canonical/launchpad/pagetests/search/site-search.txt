= Site-wide Search =

Launchpad features a site-wide search that combines Google's
site-specific search with Launchpad's prominent objects (projects,
bugs, teams, etc.).

    >>> from canonical.encoding import ascii_smash

    # Our very helpful function for printing all the page results.
    >>> def print_search_results():
    ...     tag = find_tag_by_id(anon_browser.contents, 'search-results')
    ...     if tag:
    ...         print ascii_smash(extract_text(tag))

    # Another helper to make searching convenient
    >>> def search_for(terms):
    ...     search_text = anon_browser.getControl(name='field.text', index=0)
    ...     search_text.value = terms
    ...     anon_browser.getControl(
    ...         name='field.actions.search', index=0).click()

Search is accessible to any user via the root +search url:

    >>> anon_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/+search')
    >>> print anon_browser.title
    Search Launchpad

The user does not see any search results on the page without submitting
search text. An explanation of search is included in the page when the
search field is empty.

    >>> print_search_results()

    >>> print extract_text(find_tag_by_id(anon_browser.contents, 'no-search'))
    Enter a term or many terms to find matching pages...

When the user searches for specific item, such as a project name, he
sees a result for that exact match in Launchpad.

    >>> search_for('firefox')
    >>> print anon_browser.title
    Pages matching "firefox" in Launchpad
    >>> print_search_results()
    Exact matches

Searching for an integer returns the matching bug number as well as
the matching question number, if one exists. Searching for "3", the
user sees that a bug matched.

    >>> search_for('3')
    >>> print anon_browser.title
    Pages matching "3" in Launchpad
    >>> print_search_results()
    Exact matches
    Bug #3: Bug Title Test
    ...
    3: Firefox is slow and consumes too much RAM
    ...

An arbitrary search returns a list of Google search results. The
user searches for "bug" and sees a listing of matching pages. The
navigation states that the page is showing 1 through 20 of 25 total
results.

    # Use our pre-defined search results for the 'bug' search.
    >>> search_for('bug')
    >>> print anon_browser.title
    Pages matching "bug" in Launchpad
    >>> print_search_results()
    1 &rarr; 20 of 25 pages matching "bug"...
    Launchpad Bugs...
    Bugs in Ubuntu Linux...
    Bugs related to Sample Person...
    Bug #1 in Mozilla Firefox: ...Firefox does not support SVG...
    ...

He can see there really are only twenty matches in the page.

    >>> first_page_results = list(
    ...     find_tags_by_class(anon_browser.contents, 'pagematch'))
    >>> len(first_page_results)
    20

The user sees the 'Next' link, and uses it to view the next page. It
has 5 page matches.

    >>> anon_browser.getLink('Next').click()
    >>> second_page_results = list(
    ...     find_tags_by_class(anon_browser.contents, 'pagematch'))
    >>> len(second_page_results)
    5

    >>> in_both = [match for match in second_page_results
    ...            if match in first_page_results]
    >>> in_both
    []

A search may return exact matches and matching pages. The batch
navigation text changes from "pages matching ..." to "other pages
matching ...".

    # Use our pre-defined search results for the 'launchpad' search.
    >>> search_for('launchpad')
    >>> print anon_browser.title
    Pages matching "launchpad" in Launchpad
    >>> print_search_results()
    Exact matches

    may take up to ten weeks, so you should consider downloading
    the CD image if you have a fast Internet connection.
    >>> anon_browser.getLink('Shipit Questions | ubuntu').url
    'http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/shipit-faq'


== Searches with no results ==

Searches that don't return any results display a kind message to the
user.

    >>> search_for('fnord')
    >>> print extract_text(find_main_content(anon_browser.contents))
    Pages matching "fnord" in Launchpad
    ...
    Your search for &ldquo;fnord&rdquo; did not return any results.


== Searches for the empty string ==

If the user submits the form without entering a term in the search
field, the page does not contain any results. The user can see that
the page is identical to the page visited without performing a search.

    >>> search_for('')
    >>> print anon_browser.title
    Search Launchpad
    >>> print_search_results()


== Search limits ==

The Google Custom Search Engine restricts the search to 10 terms and
they cannot exceed 2048 characters. Testing revealed that 29 terms were
actually honored by Google. Phrases are not terms; each word in the
phrase was a term. Launchpad does not impose a restriction on the
number of terms since sending more terms does not represent an error.
Launchpad imposes an artificial limit to 250 characters.

The user cannot enter more than 250 characters to in the search field.

    >>> too_many_characters = '123456789 ' * 25 + '0'
    >>> search_for(too_many_characters)
    >>> for message in get_feedback_messages(anon_browser.contents):
    ...     print message
    There is 1 error.
    The search text is limited to 10 terms, and cannot exceed 250 characters.


== Searching from any page ==

Most pages have the global search form in them. Any user can enter terms
in the page he is viewing and submit the form to see the results.

    >>> anon_browser.open('http://bugs.launchpad.dev/firefox')
    >>> print anon_browser.title

    >>> print anon_browser.url
