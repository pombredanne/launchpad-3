= Warning about imported suggestions =

When a suggestion is coming from an import, a warning is shown about the
likely licensing incompatibility.

Our sampledata contains imported Spanish translations for message
'have ' in an upstream project, and no translation in corresponding
Hoary distroseries template.

On a Hoary Evolution sourcepackage, we can see a suggestion coming
from the upstream project.

    >>> browser = setupBrowser(auth='Basic carlos@canonical.com:test')
    >>> browser.open('http://translations.launchpad.dev/ubuntu/hoary/+source/evolution/+pots/evolution-2.2/es/3/+translate')
    >>> print extract_text(find_tag_by_id(
    ...     browser.contents, 'msgset_132_es_suggestion_3_0'))
    tiene

A warning icon about the legal situation is shown alongside the suggestion
itself.

    >>> warning_link = find_tags_by_class(browser.contents, 'legal-warning')[0]
    >>> extract_link_from_tag(warning_link)
