= Posting =

Only Launchpad members are allowed to post to team mailing lists.  A message
by a sender who is not a Launchpad member will be summarily discarded.

First, create the mailing list, which will send a notification messages
to all the members of the mailing list.  We can ignore these messages.

    >>> import itest_helper
    >>> list_one = itest_helper.create_list('itest-one')
    >>> smtpd.reset()


== Non-member postings ==

Postings from addresses that are not registered and verified with Launchpad
are summarily discarded.

    # Watch Mailman's logs/vette for possible log messages.
    >>> vette_watcher = itest_helper.LogWatcher('vette')

Inject a message from a non-member into Mailman's incoming queue.

    >>> from Mailman.Post import inject
    >>> inject('itest-one', """\
    ... From: zperson@example.net
    ... To: itest-one@lists.launchpad.dev
    ... Subject: A non-member post
    ... Message-ID: <aardvark>
    ...
    ... Hi, I am not a member of Launchpad (yet).
    ... """)
    >>> vette_watcher.wait()

Message from non-members who are in unknown standing do not get posted to the
mailing list.

    >>> len(smtpd.getMessages())
    0


== Unvalidated member postings ==

Similarly, an address that has been registered with Launchpad but not verified
will also be summarily discarded.  To demonstrate this, we'll add Anne as a
normal Launchpad user, but de-certify her alternative address.  This is
equivalent to making it unvalidated.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests.mailinglists_helper import (
    ...     get_alternative_email, new_person)
    >>> from canonical.database.sqlbase import commit
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests import login, logout
    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')
    >>> anne = new_person('Anne')
    >>> alternative_email = get_alternative_email(anne)
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import EmailAddressStatus
    >>> alternative_email.status = EmailAddressStatus.NEW
    >>> commit()
    >>> print alternative_email.email, alternative_email.status.title
    aperson@example.org New Email Address

    >>> vette_watcher.resync()
    >>> inject('itest-one', """\
    ... From: aperson@example.org
    ... To: itest-one@lists.launchpad.dev
    ... Subject: A non-member post
    ... Message-ID: <beaver>
    ...
    ... Hi, I am not a verified member of Launchpad (yet).
    ... """)
    >>> vette_watcher.wait()

As above, this message got summarily discarded.

    >>> len(smtpd.getMessages())
    0


== Unsubscribed Launchpad members ==

Anne's perferred email address is still validated, and she post a message from
that address.  However, because she has not yet joined the team or subscribed
to its mailing list, her messages gets held for moderation by the team's
administrator.

    >>> print anne.preferredemail.email, anne.preferredemail.status.title
