= Posting =

Only Launchpad members are allowed to post to team mailing lists.  A message
by a sender who is not a Launchpad member will be summarily discarded.

First, create the mailing list, which will send a notification messages
to all the members of the mailing list.  We can ignore these messages.

    >>> import itest_helper
    >>> list_one = itest_helper.create_list('itest-one')
    >>> smtpd.reset()


== Non-member postings ==

Postings from addresses that are not registered and verified with Launchpad
are summarily discarded.

    # Watch Mailman's logs/vette for possible log messages.
    >>> vette_watcher = itest_helper.LogWatcher('vette')

Inject a message from a non-member into Mailman's incoming queue.

    >>> from Mailman.Post import inject
    >>> inject('itest-one', """\
    ... From: zperson@example.net
    ... To: itest-one@lists.launchpad.dev
    ... Subject: A non-member post
    ... Message-ID: <first-injection>
    ...
    ... Hi, I am not a member of Launchpad (yet).
    ... """)
    >>> vette_watcher.wait()

Message from non-members who are in unknown standing do not get posted to the
mailing list.

    >>> len(smtpd.getMessages())
    0


== Unvalidated member postings ==

Similarly, an address that has been registered with Launchpad but not verified
will also be summarily discarded.  To demonstrate this, we'll add Anne as a
normal Launchpad user, but de-certify her alternative address.  This is
equivalent to making it unvalidated.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests.mailinglists_helper import (
    ...     get_alternative_email, new_person)
    >>> from canonical.database.sqlbase import commit
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests import login, logout
    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')
    >>> anne = new_person('Anne')
    >>> alternative_email = get_alternative_email(anne)
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import EmailAddressStatus
    >>> alternative_email.status = EmailAddressStatus.NEW
    >>> commit()
    >>> print alternative_email.email, alternative_email.statusname
    aperson@example.org New Email Address

    >>> vette_watcher.resync()
    >>> inject('itest-one', """\
    ... From: aperson@example.org
    ... To: itest-one@lists.launchpad.dev
    ... Subject: A non-member post
    ... Message-ID: <second-injection>
    ...
    ... Hi, I am not a verified member of Launchpad (yet).
    ... """)
    >>> vette_watcher.wait()

As above, this message got summarily discarded.

    >>> len(smtpd.getMessages())
    0


== Unsubscribed Launchpad members ==

Since Anne's preferred email address is still validated, let's post this
message from that address.  However, because she has not yet joined the team
or subscribed to its mailing list, she still can't post to it.

    >>> print anne.preferredemail.email, anne.preferredemail.statusname
    anne.person@example.com Preferred Email Address
    >>> vette_watcher.resync()
    >>> inject('itest-one', """\
    ... From: anne.person@example.com
    ... To: itest-one@lists.launchpad.dev
    ... Subject: An unsubscribed post
    ... Message-ID: <third-injection>
    ...
    ... Hi, I am not a member of this team's list (yet).
    ... """)

    >>> vette_watcher.wait()
    >>> len(smtpd.getMessages())
    0

The message is held for team owner approval, both in Launchpad and in Mailman.

    >>> holds = itest_helper.pending_hold_ids('itest-one')
    >>> len(holds)
    1
    >>> itest_helper.print_mailman_hold('itest-one', holds[0])

    >>> print messages[0].text_contents
    Hi, I am not a member of this team's list (yet).
    <BLANKLINE>

The team administrator can accept, decline or discard this posting.  By
declining the message, Launchpad forgets about it, while Mailman sends a
rejection notice to Anne.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import (

Anne's message got posted to the mailing list.  Two copies were sent; one to
Anne herself as a member of the mailing list, and another to the
mail-archive.com archiving recipient.  These copies are very similar,
differing only in the headers used to do VERP bounce detection.

Normally, Launchpad members who are not subscribed to the mailing list cannot

However, a Launchpad member in good standing is allowed to post to any mailing

== Preventing archiver forgeries ==

We archive messages by sending them to a special address owned by the Mail
Archive <http://www.mail-archive.com>.  This address becomes a recipient of
the mailing list, but we also prevent this address from being used to post
messages to the list.
