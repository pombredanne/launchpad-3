= The Launchpad Login Service =

The Launchpad login service is an OpenID Provider intended for use by
various Canonical and Ubuntu web sites participating in Launchpad
Single Signon.


== Login Form ==

If the user has not yet authenticated to Launchpad, they are provided
with a form that allows them to do one of three things:
 * Create a new account.
 * Recover a forgotten password.
 * Log in using their email address and password.

As well as these actions, there are a number of error handling code paths:

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests import LaunchpadFormHarness
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.browser.openidserver import (
    ...     LoginServiceLoginView, LoginServiceAuthorizeView)
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IOpenIdApplication
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.webapp import LaunchpadFormView

    # Create a fake LoginServiceLoginView which stubs out OpenID-related bits
    # from its parent class.
    >>> class TestingLoginServiceLoginView(LoginServiceLoginView):
    ...     def setUpWidgets(self):
    ...         self.nonce = 'foo'
    ...         LaunchpadFormView.setUpWidgets(self)
    ...     def createPositiveResponse(self):
    ...         return True
    ...     def renderOpenIdResponse(self, response):
    ...         pass
    ...     def saveRequestInSession(self, token):
    ...         pass

A valid email address is required for any operation available on this form.

    >>> harness = LaunchpadFormHarness(
    ...     getUtility(IOpenIdApplication), TestingLoginServiceLoginView)

    >>> harness.submit('continue', {'field.email': 'foo@'})
    >>> for message in harness.getFormErrors():
    ...     print message
    Please enter a valid email address.

If the user doesn't enter the password or enters the wrong one when
attempting to login, it'll also fail.

    >>> harness.submit(
    ...     'continue',
    ...     {'field.email': 'mark@hbd.com', 'field.action': 'login'})
    >>> for message in harness.getFormErrors():
    ...     print message
    Incorrect password for the provided email address.

    >>> harness.submit('continue', {'field.email': 'mark@hbd.com',
    ...                             'field.action': 'login',
    ...                             'field.password': 'foo'})
    >>> for message in harness.getFormErrors():
    ...     print message
    Incorrect password for the provided email address.

A password with invalid characters is not allowed either.

    >> harness.submit('continue', {'field.email': 'mark@hbd.com',
    ..                             'field.action': 'login',
    ..                             'field.password': u'\xa0blah'})
    >> for message in harness.getFormErrors():
    ..     print message
    Incorrect password given.

Trying to create a new account with an email address that is registered and
associated with a valid Launchpad account is not allowed.

    >>> harness.submit('continue', {'field.email': 'test@canonical.com',
    ...                             'field.action': 'createaccount'})
    >>> for message in harness.getFormErrors():
    ...     print message
    Sorry, someone has already registered the test@canonical.com email ...

If the email address is associated with an invalid Launchpad account (aka
placeholder profile), though, we let the user continue the registration as if
we've never heard about that email address.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import EmailAddress
    >>> EmailAddress.selectOneBy(
    ...     email='andrelop@debian.org').person.is_valid_person
    False
    >>> harness.submit('continue', {'field.email': 'andrelop@debian.org',
    ...                             'field.action': 'createaccount'})
    >>> print harness.getFormErrors()
    []

To recover the password of an existing account we obviously require a
registered email address which doesn't belong to a team.

    >>> harness.submit('continue', {'field.email': 'nobody@debian.org',
    ...                             'field.action': 'resetpassword'})
    >>> for message in harness.getFormErrors():
    ...     print message
    Your account details have not been found...

    >>> harness.submit('continue', {'field.email': 'support@ubuntu.com',
    ...                             'field.action': 'resetpassword'})
    >>> for message in harness.getFormErrors():
    ...     print message
    The email address ... can not be used to log in as it belongs to a
    team.

    >>> harness.submit('continue', {'field.email': 'andrelop@debian.org',
    ...                             'field.action': 'resetpassword'})
    >>> print harness.getFormErrors()
    []
