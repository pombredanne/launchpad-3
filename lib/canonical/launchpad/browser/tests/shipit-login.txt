= Logging into shipit =

ShipIt uses the Launchpad Login Service as its OpenID provider.  When a user
tries to log into shipit, they will be taken to the Login Service, where they
will be asked to authenticate using their Launchpad account.

    # Change the rooturl of our openid vhost.  This is necessary so that the
    # python OpenID library can access the OpenID provider (made available by
    # the AppServerLayer) using HTTP requests instead of going directly
    # through zope3's publication machinery.
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.webapp.vhosts import allvhosts
    >>> orig_value = allvhosts.configs['openid'].rooturl
    >>> allvhosts.configs['openid'].rooturl = (
    ...     'http://openid.launchpad.dev:8085/')

    >>> browser.open('http://shipit.ubuntu.dev')
    >>> browser.getLink('Log In').click()

    >>> print browser.title
    OpenID transaction in progress

    # In a real browser, this form would have been auto-submitted using
    # javascript, but here we have to do that manually.
    >>> browser.getControl('Continue').click()
    >>> print browser.title
    Launchpad Login Service

After authenticating, the user is sent back to shipit for finishing the
request.

    >>> browser.getControl(name='field.email').value = 'mark@hbd.com'
    >>> browser.getControl(name='field.password').value = 'test'
    >>> browser.getControl('Continue').click()

    >>> print browser.title
    Your ShipIt Request
    >>> print extract_text(find_tags_by_class(browser.contents, 'login')[0])
    Logged in as Mark Shuttleworth...

If the user did not authorize the OpenID provider to send his details to
Shipit, an error message would be shown, explaining that the login was not
successful.

    >>> browser.open('http://shipit.ubuntu.dev')
    >>> browser.getControl('Log Out').click()
    >>> browser.getLink('Log In').click()

    >>> print browser.title
    OpenID transaction in progress

    # In a real browser, this form would have been auto-submitted using
    # javascript, but here we have to do that manually.
    >>> browser.getControl('Continue').click()
    >>> print browser.title
    Authenticate to http://shipit.ubuntu.dev

    >>> browser.getControl('Not Now').click()
    >>> print browser.title
    ShipIt - Unsuccessful login

    >>> print extract_text(find_tags_by_class(browser.contents, 'error')[0])
    User cancelled
    >>> print find_tags_by_class(browser.contents, 'login')
    []

Undo the config change we did.

    >>> allvhosts.configs['openid'].rooturl = orig_value
