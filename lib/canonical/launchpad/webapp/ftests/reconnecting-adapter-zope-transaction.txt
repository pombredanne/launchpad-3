= Reconnecting Adapter / Zope Transaction Interaction =

The reconnecting database adapter code is intended to be primarily
used within Zope applications and the Zope transaction framework.

Therefore, it is important that the adapter become usable in new Zope
transactions after an outage.

First we'll import a few things needed for the tests:

    >>> import transaction
    >>> from canonical.config import config
    >>> from canonical.database.ftests import PortForwardTestSetup
    >>> from canonical.ftests.pgsql import PgTestSetup
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.webapp.adapter import (
    ...     ReconnectingDatabaseAdapter, DisconnectionError)

Now set up a small port forwarding daemon that proxies requests
through to the database:

    >>> portforward = PortForwardTestSetup()
    >>> portforward.setUp()

And finally create a database adapter that connects to the port
forwarder, and a corresponding connection.

    >>> adapter = ReconnectingDatabaseAdapter(
    ...     'dbi://%s:@localhost:5555/%s' % (
    ...     config.launchpad.dbuser, PgTestSetup().dbname))
    >>> connection = adapter()


== Disconnection on execute() ==

First we'll simulate a disconnect on execute():

    >>> cursor = connection.cursor()
    >>> portforward.tearDown()
    >>> portforward.setUp()
    >>> cursor.execute("SELECT 1")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    DisconnectionError: ...

Now we will abort the Zope transaction and start another one.  The
connection should be usable:

    >>> transaction.abort()
    >>> cursor.execute("SELECT 1")
    >>> cursor.fetchone()[0]
    1


== Disconnection on commit() ==

Now we'll simulate a disconnection just before the commit:

    >>> transaction.abort()
    >>> cursor.execute("SELECT 1")
    >>> cursor.fetchone()[0]
    1
    >>> portforward.tearDown()
    >>> portforward.setUp()
    >>> transaction.commit()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    DisconnectionError: ...

If we abort the transaction now, the connection is usable:

    >>> transaction.abort()
    >>> cursor.execute("SELECT 1")
    >>> cursor.fetchone()[0]
    1


== Disconnection on cursor() ==

If the connection has previously been disconnected, a call to
connection.cursor() will result in an attempt to reconnect.  This is a
common case if the database connection has dropped before the
transaction starts.

    >>> portforward.tearDown()
    >>> transaction.abort()
    >>> cursor = connection.cursor()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    DisconnectionError: ...
    >>> portforward.setUp()

Now when we abort the transaction, we should have a usable connection
again:

    >>> transaction.abort()
    >>> cursor.execute("SELECT 1")
    >>> cursor.fetchone()[0]
    1


== Cleanup ==

    >>> portforward.tearDown()
