PO Import test with a .pot file that has a syntax error
-------------------------------------------------------

When we import a .pot file with a syntax error, we should notify
the user about that error so they have a chance to fix it.

In this test, we are going to check that we detect and notify the error.

Here are some imports we need to get this test running.

  >>> from canonical.database.sqlbase import flush_database_updates
  >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IPersonSet
  >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import ITranslationImportQueue
  >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import POTemplateSubset
  >>> import datetime
  >>> import pytz
  >>> UTC = pytz.timezone('UTC')
  >>> translation_import_queue = getUtility(ITranslationImportQueue)

We need this for the Librarian to work properly.

  >>> import transaction

And also, the DBSchema to change the imports status

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import RosettaImportStatus

Then, let's get a handle to our mailer. This is the thing we'll examine to show
what email has been sent, to whom, and what the body of the message contains:

  >>> import email
  >>> from canonical.launchpad.mail import stub

Login as an admin to be able to do changes to the import queue.

  >>> login('carlos@canonical.com')

Here's the person who'll be doing the import.

  >>> person_set = getUtility(IPersonSet)
  >>> person = person_set.getByName('sabdfl')

Now, is time to create the new potemplate

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import ProductRelease
  >>> release = ProductRelease.get(3)
  >>> release.productseries.product.name
  u'firefox'
  >>> series = release.productseries
  >>> subset = POTemplateSubset(productseries=series)
  >>> potemplate = subset.new(
  ...     name='firefox',
  ...     translation_domain='firefox',
  ...     path='po/firefox.pot',
  ...     owner=person)

Let's import a .pot file that is missing its header. That's a 
TranslationFormatSyntaxError

  >>> potemplate_contents = r'''
  ... msgid "foo"
  ... msgstr ""
  ... '''
  >>> published = True
  >>> entry = translation_import_queue.addOrUpdateEntry(
  ...     potemplate.path, potemplate_contents, published, person,
  ...     productseries=series, potemplate=potemplate)
  >>> transaction.commit()
  >>> entry.status = RosettaImportStatus.APPROVED
  >>> (subject, message) = potemplate.importFromQueue(entry)

The status is now FAILED:

  >>> entry.status == RosettaImportStatus.FAILED
  True

And the code composed email with a notification of the error.

  >>> subject
  u'Import problem - firefox in Mozilla Firefox trunk'
  >>> print message
  Hello Mark Shuttleworth,
  <BLANKLINE>
  On ..., you uploaded a file with translation templates for firefox in
  Mozilla Firefox trunk to Launchpad.
  <BLANKLINE>
  We were unable to import the file because of errors in its format.
