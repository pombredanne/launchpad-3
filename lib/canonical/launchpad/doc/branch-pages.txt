== BranchView ==

BranchView is the general class for displaying Branches.

>>> from zope.component import getView
>>> from zope.publisher.browser import TestRequest
>>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IBranchSet
>>> branchset = getUtility(IBranchSet)
>>> gterm_dev = branchset[15]
>>> pushed = branchset[25]
>>> gterm_dev_view = getView(gterm_dev, '+index', TestRequest())
>>> pushed_view = getView(pushed, '+index', TestRequest())

Each branch is associated to an URL on the Supermirror, that includes the name
of the owner and product of the branch.

>>> gterm_dev_view.supermirror_url()
u'http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~name12/gnome-terminal/main'

The branch view generates an appropriate notice when a branch is missing a
title or summary.

>>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IProductSet
>>> gterm_product = getUtility(IProductSet).getByName('gnome-terminal')
>>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IPersonSet
>>> ddaa = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('ddaa')

>>> new = branchset.new('ok', ddaa, gterm_product, None,
...     title='something', summary='something')
>>> view = getView(new, '+index', TestRequest())
>>> view.missing_title_or_summary_text() is None
True

>>> new = branchset.new('no_title', ddaa, gterm_product, None,
...     title=None, summary='something')
>>> view = getView(new, '+index', TestRequest())
>>> view.missing_title_or_summary_text()
'(this branch has no title)'

>>> new = branchset.new('no_summary', ddaa, gterm_product, None,
...     title='something', summary=None)
>>> view = getView(new, '+index', TestRequest())
>>> view.missing_title_or_summary_text()
'(this branch has no summary)'

>>> new = branchset.new('no_title_or_summary', ddaa, gterm_product, None,
...     title=None, summary=None)
>>> view = getView(new, '+index', TestRequest())
>>> view.missing_title_or_summary_text()
'(this branch has neither title nor summary)'

== PersonBranchesView ==

PersonBranchesView is the view used to produce the branch table in a person.
Its distinguishing feature is the branch_role method, which explains why the
branch appears in the table.

>>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IPersonSet
>>> sampleperson = getUtility(IPersonSet).get(12)
>>> sampleperson_branches_view = getView(
...     sampleperson, '+branches', TestRequest())

Roles are dictionaries of two items: 'title', used for display, and 'sortkey',
used for sorting.

The role can be "Author", if the person is pointed to by the 'author' attribute
of the branch.

>>> gterm_klingon = branchset[18]
>>> gterm_klingon.author == sampleperson
True
>>> sampleperson_branches_view.branch_role(gterm_klingon)['title']
'Author'

If the person is not the branch's author, the role is "Registrant" if the
person is pointed to by the 'owner' attribute of the branch.

>>> gterm_dev.author == sampleperson
False
>>> gterm_dev.owner == sampleperson
True
>>> sampleperson_branches_view.branch_role(gterm_dev)['title']
'Registrant'

If the person is neither author nor registrant of a branch, role is
"Subscriber" if the person is indeed subscribed to the branch.

>>> gterm_launchpad = branchset[24]
>>> gterm_launchpad.author == sampleperson
False
>>> gterm_launchpad.owner == sampleperson
False
>>> sampleperson in gterm_launchpad.subscribers
True
>>> sampleperson_branches_view.branch_role(gterm_launchpad)['title']
'Subscriber'

Finally, if the branch is not related to the person at all, role is undefined
and the branch_role method raises an exception.

>>> thunderbird_main = branchset[2]
>>> thunderbird_main.author == sampleperson
False
>>> thunderbird_main.owner == sampleperson
False
>>> sampleperson in thunderbird_main.subscribers
False
>>> try:
...     sampleperson_branches_view.branch_role(thunderbird_main)
... except Exception, exception:
...     print exception
Unable determine role of person u'name12' for branch u'~stevea/thunderbird/main'

== Contextual branch views ==

BranchInPersonView and BranchInProductView are used to display branch listing
items in person and product context. They provide a couple of extra attributes
and properties to know whether to display links to the person or product
associated to the branch.

The view used to render list items is chosen using the in_person_context and
in_product_context methods on BranchTargetView.

>>> gterm_branches_view = getView(
...     gterm_product, '+branchlisting', TestRequest())
>>> gterm_branches_view.in_person_context()
False
>>> gterm_branches_view.in_product_context()
True

>>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IPersonSet
>>> sampleperson = getUtility(IPersonSet).get(12)
>>> sampleperson_branches_view = getView(
...     sampleperson, '+branchlisting', TestRequest())
>>> sampleperson_branches_view.in_person_context()
True
>>> sampleperson_branches_view.in_product_context()
False

These methods behave the same in a Team context as in a normal person context.

>>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IPersonSet
>>> ubuntuteam = getUtility(IPersonSet).get(17)
>>> ubuntuteam_branches_view = getView(ubuntuteam, '+branchlisting', TestRequest())
>>> ubuntuteam_branches_view.in_person_context()
True
>>> ubuntuteam_branches_view.in_product_context()
False

These methods are used to decide whether to display the
+product-summary-listing or +person-summary listing view to generate branch
list items.

When viewing a branch listing in product context, we should display the link to
a corresponding person.

>>> gterm_dev_product_view = getView(gterm_dev, '+product-summary-listing', TestRequest())
>>> gterm_dev_product_view.show_person_link
True
>>> gterm_dev_product_view.show_product_link
False

And when in a person context, we should link to the branch's product.

>>> gterm_dev_product_view = getView(gterm_dev, '+person-summary-listing', TestRequest())
>>> gterm_dev_product_view.show_person_link
False
>>> gterm_dev_product_view.show_product_link
True

When in a person context and the branch does not have an associated product, we
should display none of those links.

>>> junk_dev = branchset[20]
>>> print junk_dev.product
None
>>> junk_dev_person_view = getView(junk_dev, '+person-summary-listing', TestRequest())
>>> junk_dev_person_view.show_person_link
False
>>> junk_dev_person_view.show_product_link
False

== BranchEditView ==

When a branch has a URL, the user is allowed to modify it. Check that the
'url' field is present in the edit form.

>>> gterm_dev.url is not None
True
>>> view = getView(gterm_dev, '+edit', TestRequest())
>>> view.setUpFields()
>>> 'url' in [field.__name__ for field in view.form_fields]
True

When a branch's URL is null, the user is not allowed to set it.

>>> no_url = branchset.new('no_url', ddaa, gterm_product, None)
>>> no_url.url is None
True
>>> view = getView(no_url, '+edit', TestRequest())
>>> view.setUpFields()
>>> 'url' in [field.__name__ for field in view.form_fields]
False

Thus, a branch cannot change between being a pull branch and a push branch
through the web interface.
