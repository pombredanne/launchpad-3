== BranchView ==

BranchView is the general class for displaying Branches.

    >>> from zope.component import getMultiAdapter
    >>> from zope.publisher.browser import TestRequest
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IBranchSet
    >>> branchset = getUtility(IBranchSet)
    >>> gterm_dev = branchset[15]
    >>> pushed = branchset[25]
    >>> gterm_dev_view = getMultiAdapter((gterm_dev, TestRequest()), name='+index')
    >>> pushed_view = getMultiAdapter((pushed, TestRequest()), name='+index')

Each branch is associated to an URL on the Supermirror, that includes the name
of the owner and product of the branch.

If the branch does not have any revisions, then a download URL is not shown.

    >>> print gterm_dev_view.bzr_download_url()
    None

Mark the branch as having revisions to see the URL.

    >>> from zope.security.proxy import removeSecurityProxy
    >>> removeSecurityProxy(gterm_dev_view.context).revision_count = 5
    >>> print gterm_dev_view.bzr_download_url()
    http://bazaar.launchpad.dev/~name12/gnome-terminal/main


== Contextual branch views ==

BranchInPersonView and BranchInProductView are used to display branch listing
items in person and product context. They provide a couple of extra attributes
and properties to know whether to display links to the person or product
associated to the branch.

When viewing a branch listing in product context, we should display the link to
a corresponding person.

    >>> gterm_dev_product_view = getMultiAdapter(
    ...     (gterm_dev, TestRequest()), name='+product-summary-listing')
    >>> gterm_dev_product_view.show_person_link
    True
    >>> gterm_dev_product_view.show_product_link
    False

And when in a person context, we should link to the branch's product.

    >>> gterm_dev_product_view = getMultiAdapter(
    ...     (gterm_dev, TestRequest()), name='+person-summary-listing')
    >>> gterm_dev_product_view.show_person_link
    False
    >>> gterm_dev_product_view.show_product_link
    True

When in a person context and the branch does not have an associated product, we
should display none of those links.

    >>> junk_dev = branchset[20]
    >>> print junk_dev.product
    None
    >>> junk_dev_person_view = getMultiAdapter(
    ...     (junk_dev, TestRequest()), name='+person-summary-listing')
    >>> junk_dev_person_view.show_person_link
    False
    >>> junk_dev_person_view.show_product_link
    False

== BranchEditView ==

When a branch has a URL, the user is allowed to modify it. Check that the
'url' field is present in the edit form.

    >>> gterm_dev.url is not None
    True
    >>> view = getMultiAdapter((gterm_dev, TestRequest()), name='+edit')
    >>> view.setUpFields()
    >>> 'url' in [field.__name__ for field in view.form_fields]
    True

When a branch's URL is null, the user is not allowed to set it.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import BranchType, IProductSet
    >>> gterm_product = getUtility(IProductSet).getByName('gnome-terminal')
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IPersonSet
    >>> ddaa = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('ddaa')
    >>> no_url = branchset.new(
    ...     BranchType.HOSTED, 'no_url', ddaa, ddaa, gterm_product, None)
    >>> no_url.url is None
    True
    >>> view = getMultiAdapter((no_url, TestRequest()), name='+edit')
    >>> view.setUpFields()
    >>> 'url' in [field.__name__ for field in view.form_fields]
    False

Thus, a branch cannot change between being a pull branch and a push branch
through the web interface.


== PersonBranchesView ==

PersonBranchesView is the view used to produce the branch table for a person.
Its distinguishing feature is the roleForBranch method, which explains why the
branch appears in the table.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IPersonSet
    >>> sampleperson = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('name12')
    >>> sampleperson_branches_view = getMultiAdapter(
    ...     (sampleperson, TestRequest()), name='+branches')

The role can be "Author", if the person is pointed to by the 'author' attribute
of the branch.

    >>> gterm_klingon = branchset[18]
    >>> gterm_klingon.author == sampleperson
    True
    >>> sampleperson_branches_view.roleForBranch(gterm_klingon)
    'Author'

If the person is not the branch's author, the role is "Registrant" if the
person is pointed to by the 'owner' attribute of the branch.

    >>> gterm_dev.author == sampleperson
    False
    >>> gterm_dev.owner == sampleperson
    True
    >>> sampleperson_branches_view.roleForBranch(gterm_dev)
    'Registrant'

If the person is neither author nor registrant of a branch, role is
"Subscriber" if the person is indeed subscribed to the branch.

    >>> gterm_launchpad = branchset[24]
    >>> gterm_launchpad.author == sampleperson
    False
    >>> gterm_launchpad.owner == sampleperson
    False
    >>> sampleperson in gterm_launchpad.subscribers
    True
    >>> sampleperson_branches_view.roleForBranch(gterm_launchpad)
    'Subscriber'


== BranchListingView ==

When listing the branches for a product we use a subclass of the
BranchListingView.

Now we are showing bug badges for branches that have associated bugs
(through BugBranch), and we want to check that when constructing
the view we get all the associated bugs for all the branches so we
don't issue many queries to the database.

    >>> firefox_product = getUtility(IProductSet).getByName('firefox')
    >>> view = getMultiAdapter(
    ...     (firefox_product, TestRequest()), name='+branches')
    >>> view.initialize()

The view batches the results.  The method that returns the batch is 'branches'.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.webapp.testing import verifyObject
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IBranchBatchNavigator
    >>> branches = view.branches()
    >>> verifyObject(IBranchBatchNavigator, branches)
    True

    >>> for branch in branches.branches():
    ...     bugs = []
    ...     if branch.bug_branches:
    ...         bugs = sorted([
    ...             bugbranch.bug.id for bugbranch in branch.bug_branches])
    ...     print branch.unique_name, bugs
    ...
