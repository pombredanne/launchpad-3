== Displaying results of condorcet polls ==

  >>> from zope.component import getUtility, getMultiAdapter
  >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IPollSet, IPersonSet
  >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests import login
  >>> from zope.publisher.browser import TestRequest

  >>> login("test@canonical.com")

  >>> ubuntu_team = getUtility(IPersonSet).get(17)
  >>> poll = getUtility(IPollSet).getByTeamAndName(ubuntu_team, 'director-2004')
  >>> poll.type.title
  'Condorcet Voting'

Although condorcet polls are disabled now, everything is implemented and we're
using a pairwise matrix to display the results. It's very trick to create this
matrix on page templates, so the view provides a method wich return this
matrix as a python list, with the necessary headers (the option's names).

  >>> poll_results = getMultiAdapter((poll, TestRequest()), name="+index")
  >>> for row in poll_results.getPairwiseMatrixWithHeaders():
  ...     print row
  [None, u'A', u'B', u'C', u'D']
  [u'A', None, 2L, 2L, 2L]
  [u'B', 2L, None, 2L, 2L]
  [u'C', 1L, 1L, None, 1L]
  [u'D', 2L, 1L, 2L, None]

== Voting on closed polls ==

This is not allowed, and apart from not linking to the +vote page and not
even displaying its content for a closed poll, we also have some lower
level checks.

    >>> request = TestRequest(form={'changevote': 'Change Vote'})
    >>> request.method = 'POST'
    >>> voting_page = getMultiAdapter((poll, request), name="+vote-condorcet")
    >>> form_processed = False
    >>> def form_processing():
    ...     form_processed = True
    >>> voting_page.processCondorcetVotingForm = form_processing
    >>> voting_page.processForm()

    >>> form_processed
    False
    >>> voting_page.feedback
    'This poll is not open.'
