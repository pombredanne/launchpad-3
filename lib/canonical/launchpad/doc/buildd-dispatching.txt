= Buildd Dispatching =

    >>> import transaction
    >>> import logging
    >>> logger = logging.getLogger()
    >>> logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

The buildd dispatching basically consists of finding a available
Buildd-slave in IDLE state, push required files to it, then request
the it to start a build procedure.

Those tasks are implemented by the BuilddMaster and BuilderGroup
classes.

    >>> from canonical.buildmaster.master import BuilddMaster
    >>> bm = BuilddMaster(logger, transaction)

Setup the test builder:

    >>> from canonical.buildd.ftests import BuilddSlaveTestSetup
    >>> BuilddSlaveTestSetup().setUp()

Setup a suitable chroot for Hoary i386:

    >>> from canonical.librarian.interfaces import ILibrarianClient
    >>> from StringIO import StringIO
    >>> librarian_client = getUtility(ILibrarianClient)

    >>> content = 'anything'
    >>> alias_id = librarian_client.addFile(
    ...    'foo.tar.gz', len(content), StringIO(content), 'text/plain')

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import (
    ...     IDistributionSet, ILibraryFileAliasSet)
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import PackagePublishingPocket

    >>> hoary = getUtility(IDistributionSet)['ubuntu']['hoary']
    >>> hoary_i386 = hoary['i386']

    >>> chroot = getUtility(ILibraryFileAliasSet)[alias_id]
    >>> pc = hoary_i386.addOrUpdateChroot(chroot=chroot)

Activate builders present in sampledata, we need to be logged in as a
member of launchpad-buildd-admin:

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests import login
    >>> login('celso.providelo@canonical.com')

Set IBuilder.builderok of all present builders:

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IBuilderSet
    >>> builder_set = getUtility(IBuilderSet)

    >>> builder_set.count()
    2

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests import syncUpdate
    >>> for b in builder_set:
    ...     b.builderok = True
    ...     syncUpdate(b)

Clean up previous BuildQueue results from sampledata:

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IBuildQueueSet
    >>> lost_job = getUtility(IBuildQueueSet).get(1)
    >>> lost_job.builder.name
    u'bob'
    >>> lost_job.destroySelf()

Setup BuilddMaster class:

    >>> bm.addDistroArchSeries(hoary_i386)
    >>> bm.setupBuilders(hoary_i386)
    WARNING:root.builders.x86:frog (http://localhost:9221/) marked as failed due to: (111, 'Connection refused')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    error: (111, 'Connection refused')

Check if there are builders available:

    >>> bob_builder = builder_set['bob']
    >>> bob_builder.name
    u'bob'
    >>> bob_builder.virtualized
    False
    >>> bob_builder.is_available
    True

Verify how the nonexistent builder was excluded, marked as failed:

    >>> frog_builder = builder_set['frog']
    >>> frog_builder.builderok
    False
    >>> print frog_builder.failnotes
    (111, 'Connection refused')
    >>> frog_builder.is_available
    False


== Builder dispatching API ==

Now let's check the build candidates which will be considered for the
builder 'bob':

    >>> job = bob_builder.findBuildCandidate()

The single BuildQueue found is a non-virtual pending build:

    >>> job.id
    2
    >>> job.build.buildstate.name
    'NEEDSBUILD'
    >>> job.builder is None
    True
    >>> job.buildstart is None
    True
    >>> job.is_virtualized
    False

Update the SourcePackageReleaseFile corresponding to this job:

    >>> content = 'anything'
    >>> alias_id = librarian_client.addFile(
    ...    'foo.dsc', len(content), StringIO(content), 'application/dsc')

    >>> sprf = job.build.sourcepackagerelease.files[0]
    >>> from zope.security.proxy import removeSecurityProxy
    >>> naked_sprf = removeSecurityProxy(sprf)
    >>> naked_sprf.libraryfile = getUtility(ILibraryFileAliasSet)[alias_id]
    >>> flush_database_updates()

Check the dispatching method itself:

    >>> bob_builder.dispatchBuildCandidate(job)
    >>> flush_database_updates()

Verify if the job (BuildQueue) was updated appropriately:

    >>> job.builder.id == bob_builder.id
    True

    >>> job.build.buildstate.name
    'BUILDING'

    >>> from canonical.database.sqlbase import get_transaction_timestamp
    >>> job.buildstart == get_transaction_timestamp()
    True

Shutdown builder, mark the build record as failed and remove the
buildqueue record, so the build was eliminated:

    >>> BuilddSlaveTestSetup().tearDown()

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import BuildStatus
    >>> job.build.buildstate = BuildStatus.FAILEDTOBUILD
    >>> job.destroySelf()
    >>> flush_database_updates()


== PPA build dispatching ==

Create new Build record of the same source targeted for a PPA archive:

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IPersonSet
    >>> cprov = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('cprov')

    >>> ppa_build = sprf.sourcepackagerelease.createBuild(
    ...     hoary_i386, PackagePublishingPocket.RELEASE, cprov.archive)

Create BuildQueue record and inspect some parameters:

    >>> ppa_job = ppa_build.createBuildQueueEntry()
    >>> ppa_job.id
    3
    >>> ppa_job.builder == None
    True
    >>> ppa_job.buildstart == None
    True

The build job's archive requires virtualized builds.

    >>> ppa_job.build.archive.require_virtualized
    True

But the builder is not virtualized.

    >>> bob_builder.virtualized
    False

Hence, the builder will not be able to pick up the PPA build job created
above.

    >>> bob_builder.vm_host = 'localhost.ppa'
    >>> syncUpdate(bob_builder)

    >>> job = bob_builder.findBuildCandidate()
    >>> print job
    None

In order to enable 'bob' to find and build the PPA job, we have to
change it to virtualized.  This is because PPA builds will only build
on virtualized builders.  We also need to make sure this build's source
is published, or it will also be ignored (by superseding it).  We can
do this by copying the existing publication in Ubuntu.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.database.publishing import (
    ...     SourcePackagePublishingHistory)
    >>> [old_pub] = SourcePackagePublishingHistory.selectBy(
    ...    distroseries=ppa_job.build.distroseries,
    ...    sourcepackagerelease=ppa_job.build.sourcepackagerelease)
    >>> new_pub = old_pub.copyTo(
    ...     old_pub.distroseries, old_pub.pocket, ppa_job.build.archive)

    >>> bob_builder.virtualized = True
    >>> syncUpdate(bob_builder)

    >>> job = bob_builder.findBuildCandidate()
    >>> ppa_job.id == job.id
    True

Start buildd-slave to be able to dispatch jobs.

    >>> BuilddSlaveTestSetup().setUp()

Before dispatching we can check if the builder is protected against
mistakes in code that results in a attempt to build a virtual job in
a non-virtual build.

    >>> bob_builder.virtualized = False
    >>> flush_database_updates()
    >>> bob_builder.dispatchBuildCandidate(ppa_job)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    AssertionError: Attempt to build non-virtual item on a virtual builder.

Mark the builder as virtual again, so we can dispatch the ppa job
successfully.

    >>> bob_builder.virtualized = True
    >>> flush_database_updates()

    >>> bob_builder.dispatchBuildCandidate(ppa_job)
    >>> flush_database_updates()

PPA job is building.

    >>> ppa_job.builder.name
    u'bob'

    >>> ppa_job.build.buildstate.name
    'BUILDING'

    >>> ppa_job.buildstart == get_transaction_timestamp()
    True

Shutdown builder slave, mark the ppa build record as failed, remove the
buildqueue record and make 'bob' builder non-virtual again,  so the
environment is back to the initial state.

    >>> BuilddSlaveTestSetup().tearDown()

    >>> ppa_job.build.buildstate = BuildStatus.FAILEDTOBUILD
    >>> ppa_job.destroySelf()
    >>> bob_builder.virtualized = False
    >>> flush_database_updates()


== Security build dispatching ==

Setup chroot for warty/i386.

    >>> warty = getUtility(IDistributionSet)['ubuntu']['warty']
    >>> warty_i386 = warty['i386']
    >>> pc = warty_i386.addOrUpdateChroot(chroot=chroot)

Create a new Build record for test source targeted to warty/i386
architecture and SECURITY pocket:

    >>> sec_build = sprf.sourcepackagerelease.createBuild(
    ...     warty_i386, PackagePublishingPocket.SECURITY, hoary.main_archive)

Create BuildQueue record and inspect some parameters:

    >>> sec_job = sec_build.createBuildQueueEntry()
    >>> sec_job.id
    4
    >>> print sec_job.builder
    None
    >>> print sec_job.buildstart
    None
    >>> sec_job.is_virtualized
    False

In normal conditions the next available candidate would be the job
targeted to SECURITY pocket. However, the builders are forbidden to
accept such jobs until we have finished the EMBARGOED archive
implementation.

    >>> BuilddSlaveTestSetup().setUp()
    >>> bob_builder.dispatchBuildCandidate(sec_job)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    AssertionError: Soyuz is not yet capable of building SECURITY uploads.
    >>> BuilddSlaveTestSetup().tearDown()

To solve this problem temporarily until we start building security
uploads, we will mark builds targeted to the SECURITY pocket as
FAILEDTOBUILD during the findBuildCandidate look-up.

We will also create another build candidate in breezy-autotest/i386 to
check if legitimate pending candidates will remain valid.

    >>> breezy = getUtility(IDistributionSet)['ubuntu']['breezy-autotest']
    >>> breezy_i386 = breezy['i386']
    >>> pc = breezy_i386.addOrUpdateChroot(chroot=chroot)

    >>> pending_build = sprf.sourcepackagerelease.createBuild(
    ...     breezy_i386, PackagePublishingPocket.UPDATES, hoary.main_archive)
    >>> pending_job = pending_build.createBuildQueueEntry()

We increase the score of the security job to ensure it is considered
before the legitimate job.

    >>> sec_job.lastscore = 1000
    >>> flush_database_updates()

New we can check that the next valid candidate is the just-added
'pending_job', ensuring that it's published before doing so.

    >>> new_pub = old_pub.copyTo(
    ...     pending_build.distroseries, old_pub.pocket, pending_build.archive)
    >>> candidate = bob_builder.findBuildCandidate()
    >>> flush_database_updates()
    >>> candidate.id == pending_job.id
    True

And as expected, the security job was marked as FAILEDTOBUILD and the
corresponding BuildQueue record was removed.  This way the security
builds, created due to missing binary uploads from DAK, will be
appropriately recorded and ignored.

    >>> print sec_build.buildstate.name
    FAILEDTOBUILD
    >>> print sec_build.buildqueue_record
    None
