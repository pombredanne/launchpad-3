= Buildd Dispatching =

  >>> import transaction
  >>> import logging
  >>> logger = logging.getLogger()
  >>> logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

The buildd dispatching basically consists of finding a available
Buildd-slave in IDLE state, push required files to it, then request
the it to start a build procedure.

Those tasks are implemented by the BuilddMaster and BuilderGroup
classes.

  >>> from canonical.buildmaster.master import BuilddMaster
  >>> bm = BuilddMaster(logger, transaction)

Setup the test builder:

  >>> from canonical.buildd.ftests import BuilddSlaveTestSetup
  >>> BuilddSlaveTestSetup().setUp()

Setup a suitable chroot for Hoary i386:

  >>> from canonical.librarian.interfaces import ILibrarianClient
  >>> from StringIO import StringIO
  >>> librarian_client = getUtility(ILibrarianClient)

  >>> content = 'anything'
  >>> alias_id = librarian_client.addFile(
  ...    'foo.tar.gz', len(content), StringIO(content), 'text/plain')

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import (
  ...     IDistributionSet, ILibraryFileAliasSet)
  >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import PackagePublishingPocket

  >>> hoary_i386 = getUtility(IDistributionSet)['ubuntu']['hoary']['i386']

  >>> chroot = getUtility(ILibraryFileAliasSet)[alias_id]
  >>> pc = hoary_i386.addOrUpdateChroot(chroot=chroot)

Activate builders present in sampledata, we need to be logged in as a
member of launchpad-buildd-admin:

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests import login
  >>> login('celso.providelo@canonical.com')

Set IBuilder.builderok of all present builders:

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IBuilderSet
  >>> builder_set = getUtility(IBuilderSet)

  >>> builder_set.count()
  2

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests import syncUpdate
  >>> for b in builder_set:
  ...     b.builderok = True
  ...     syncUpdate(b)

Clean up previous BuildQueue results from sampledata:

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IBuildQueueSet
  >>> lost_job = getUtility(IBuildQueueSet).get(1)
  >>> lost_job.builder.name
  u'bob'
  >>> lost_job.destroySelf()

Setup BuilddMaster class:

  >>> bm.addDistroArchSeries(hoary_i386)
  >>> bm.setupBuilders(hoary_i386)
  WARNING:root.builders.x86:frog (http://localhost:9221/) marked as failed due to: (111, 'Connection refused')
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
  error: (111, 'Connection refused')

Check if there are builders available:

  >>> bob_builder = builder_set['bob']
  >>> bob_builder.name
  u'bob'
  >>> bob_builder.trusted
  True
  >>> bob_builder.is_available
  True

Verify how the nonexistent builder was excluded, marked as failed:

  >>> frog_builder = builder_set['frog']
  >>> frog_builder.builderok
  False
  >>> print frog_builder.failnotes
  (111, 'Connection refused')
  >>> frog_builder.is_available
  False

Now let's check the build candidates which will be considered for the
builder 'bob':

  >>> job = bob_builder.findBuildCandidate()

The single BuildQueue found is a trusted pending build:

  >>> job.id
  2
  >>> job.build.buildstate.name
  'NEEDSBUILD'
  >>> job.builder is None
  True
  >>> job.buildstart is None
  True
  >>> job.is_trusted
  True

Update the SourcePackageReleaseFile corresponding to this job:

  >>> content = 'anything'
  >>> alias_id = librarian_client.addFile(
  ...    'foo.dsc', len(content), StringIO(content), 'application/dsc')

  >>> sprf = job.build.sourcepackagerelease.files[0]
  >>> from zope.security.proxy import removeSecurityProxy
  >>> naked_sprf = removeSecurityProxy(sprf)
  >>> naked_sprf.libraryfile = getUtility(ILibraryFileAliasSet)[alias_id]
  >>> flush_database_updates()

Check the dispatching method itself:

  >>> bob_builder.dispatchBuildCandidate(job)
  >>> flush_database_updates()

Verify if the job (BuildQueue) was updated appropriately:

  >>> job.builder.id == bob_builder.id
  True
  >>> job.build.buildstate.name
  'BUILDING'
  >>> job.buildstart
  CURRENT_TIMESTAMP AT TIME ZONE 'UTC'

Shutdown builder, mark the build record as failed and remove the
buildqueue record, so the build was eliminated:

  >>> BuilddSlaveTestSetup().tearDown()

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import BuildStatus
  >>> job.build.buildstate = BuildStatus.FAILEDTOBUILD
  >>> job.destroySelf()
  >>> flush_database_updates()

Restart buildd-slave:

  >>> BuilddSlaveTestSetup().setUp()

Create new Build record of the same source targeted for a PPA archive:

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IPersonSet
  >>> cprov = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('cprov')

  >>> ppa_build = sprf.sourcepackagerelease.createBuild(
  ...     hoary_i386, PackagePublishingPocket.RELEASE, cprov.archive)

Create BuildQueue record and inspect some parameters:

  >>> ppa_job = ppa_build.createBuildQueueEntry()
  >>> ppa_job.id
  3L
  >>> ppa_job.builder == None
  True
  >>> ppa_job.buildstart == None
  True
  >>> ppa_job.is_trusted
  False

  >>> bob_builder.trusted = False
  >>> flush_database_updates()

  >>> job = bob_builder.findBuildCandidate()
  >>> ppa_job.id == job.id
  True

  >>> bob_builder.dispatchBuildCandidate(ppa_job)
  >>> flush_database_updates()

Anyway, after making 'bob' builder available to build *untrusted*
code, and dispatching pending jobs, we can see that ppa_job is building:

  >>> ppa_job.builder.name
  u'bob'
  >>> ppa_job.build.buildstate.name
  'BUILDING'
  >>> ppa_job.buildstart
  CURRENT_TIMESTAMP AT TIME ZONE 'UTC'
