= Team mailing list subscriptions =

Members of a team, either direct or indirect, may subscribe to that team's
mailing list, if it has one.  To illustrate, we'll first create a bunch of
people, a team and its team mailing list.

    # login() as an admin so that we can call join() on anyone
    # and change their mailing list auto-subscription settings.
    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')

    # We'll need this throughout the test script.
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests import syncUpdate

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests.mailinglists_helper import (
    ...     get_alternative_email, new_person)
    >>> anne = new_person('Anne')

Anne gets two email addresses.  One is her preferred address...

    >>> anne.preferredemail.email
    u'anne.person@example.com'

...and the other is her alternative address.

    >>> get_alternative_email(anne).email
    u'aperson@example.org'

    >>> bart = new_person('Bart')
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests.mailinglists_helper import new_team
    >>> team_one, list_one = new_team('team-one', with_list=True)

    >>> anne.join(team_one)
    >>> bart.join(team_one)

    # No Privileges Person shows up as a team member because he created the
    # team (in the doctest infrastructure).
    >>> sorted(member.displayname for member in team_one.allmembers)
    [u'Anne Person', u'Bart Person', u'No Privileges Person']

Anne subscribes to the mailing list for team one.  Because Anne does not
provide an email address when she subscribes, her preferred address is used.

    >>> list_one.subscribe(anne)
    >>> sorted(email.email for email in list_one.getSubscribedAddresses())
    [u'anne.person@example.com']

Now Bart also subscribes to the mailing list, but he does so with something
other than his preferred email address.

    >>> alternative_email = get_alternative_email(bart)
    >>> alternative_email.email
    u'bperson@example.org'
    >>> list_one.subscribe(bart, alternative_email)
    >>> sorted(email.email for email in list_one.getSubscribedAddresses())
    [u'anne.person@example.com', u'bperson@example.org']

A team can not subscribe to a mailing list.

    >>> list_one.subscribe(team_one)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    CannotSubscribe: Teams cannot be mailing list members: Team One

A user's subscribed address is the address to which they'll receive posted
messages.  However, the user may post a message from any of the addresses
they've confirmed with Launchpad.

    >>> sorted(email.email for email in list_one.getSenderAddresses())
    [u'anne.person@example.com', u'aperson@example.org',
     u'bart.person@example.com', u'bperson@example.org']

However, should Anne register a new, but not-validated email address, she may
not post from it.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IEmailAddressSet
    >>> address_set = getUtility(IEmailAddressSet)
    >>> alternative = address_set.new('anne.x.person@example.net', anne)
    >>> alternative.email
    u'anne.x.person@example.net'
    >>> sorted(email.email for email in list_one.getSenderAddresses())
    [u'anne.person@example.com', u'aperson@example.org',
     u'bart.person@example.com', u'bperson@example.org']

Once Anne validates her new address, she can post from it.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import EmailAddressStatus
    >>> alternative.status = EmailAddressStatus.VALIDATED
    >>> syncUpdate(alternative)
    >>> sorted(email.email for email in list_one.getSenderAddresses())
    [u'anne.person@example.com', u'anne.x.person@example.net',
     u'aperson@example.org',
     u'bart.person@example.com', u'bperson@example.org']

    # Reverse the validation so that it doesn't affect subsequent tests.
    >>> alternative.status = EmailAddressStatus.NEW
    >>> syncUpdate(alternative)


== MailingListSubscription objects ==

MailingListSubscription objects make it possible to see under which
address (if any) a user is subscribed. That information is available
as the email_address member.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.webapp.testing import verifyObject
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IMailingListSubscription
    >>> subscription = list_one.getSubscription(bart)
    >>> verifyObject(IMailingListSubscription, subscription)
    True

    >>> subscription.email_address.email
    u'bperson@example.org'

Every subscription has a corresponding MailingListSubscription object,
but not every MailingListSubscription object names a specific email
address. If a user is subscribed under their preferred address, the
corresponding MailingListSubscription object will exist but not be
associated with any specific address.

    >>> print list_one.getSubscription(anne).email_address
    None


== Nested teams ==

Indirect members can subscribe to a team's mailing list.  To illustrate this,
we first create team-two as a subteam of team-one.

    >>> team_two = new_team('team-two')

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IPersonSet
    >>> salgado = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('salgado')
    >>> team_two.join(team_one, salgado)
    >>> sorted(member.displayname for member in team_one.allmembers)
    [u'Anne Person', u'Bart Person', u'No Privileges Person', u'Team Two']

Cris joins team-two, becoming a direct member of team-two and an indirect
member of team-one.

    >>> cris = new_person('Cris')
    >>> cris.join(team_two)
    >>> sorted(member.displayname for member in team_two.allmembers)
    [u'Cris Person', u'No Privileges Person']
    >>> sorted(member.displayname for member in team_one.allmembers)
    [u'Anne Person', u'Bart Person', u'Cris Person', u'No Privileges Person',
     u'Team Two']

Now, by virtue of her indirect membership in team-one, Cris can subscribe to
team-one's mailing list.

    >>> list_one.subscribe(cris)
    >>> sorted(email.email for email in list_one.getSubscribedAddresses())
    [u'anne.person@example.com', u'bperson@example.org',
     u'cris.person@example.com']

Cris may post to the mailing list using any of her registered and validated
email addresses.

    >>> sorted(email.email for email in list_one.getSenderAddresses())
    [u'anne.person@example.com', u'aperson@example.org',
     u'bart.person@example.com', u'bperson@example.org',
     u'cperson@example.org', u'cris.person@example.com']

Any new address that Cris registers but does not validate may not yet be used
to post to the mailing list.

    >>> alternative = address_set.new('cris.x.person@example.net', cris)
    >>> alternative.email
    u'cris.x.person@example.net'
    >>> sorted(email.email for email in list_one.getSenderAddresses())
    [u'anne.person@example.com', u'aperson@example.org',
     u'bart.person@example.com', u'bperson@example.org',
     u'cperson@example.org', u'cris.person@example.com']

Once Cris validates her new address, she can post from it.

    >>> alternative.status = EmailAddressStatus.VALIDATED
    >>> syncUpdate(alternative)
    >>> sorted(email.email for email in list_one.getSenderAddresses())
    [u'anne.person@example.com', u'aperson@example.org',
     u'bart.person@example.com', u'bperson@example.org',
     u'cperson@example.org', u'cris.person@example.com',
     u'cris.x.person@example.net']

    # Reverse the validation so that it doesn't affect subsequent tests.
    >>> alternative.status = EmailAddressStatus.NEW
    >>> syncUpdate(alternative)

People can subscribe to both a superteam's mailing list and a subteam's
mailing list.

    >>> super_team, super_team_list = new_team('super-team', with_list=True)
    >>> sub_team, sub_team_list = new_team('sub-team', with_list=True)
    >>> super_team.addMember(sub_team, salgado, force_team_add=True)
    >>> lars = new_person('Lars')
    >>> lars.join(super_team)
    >>> lars.join(sub_team)
    >>> super_team_list.subscribe(lars)
    >>> sub_team_list.subscribe(lars)
    >>> sorted(email.email
    ...        for email in super_team_list.getSubscribedAddresses())
    [u'lars.person@example.com']
    >>> sorted(email.email for email in sub_team_list.getSubscribedAddresses())
    [u'lars.person@example.com']

This is true even if the person's subscription in the superteam's list is
allowed due to indirect membership in the superteam.

    >>> team_three, list_three = new_team('team-three', with_list=True)
    >>> team_one.addMember(team_three, salgado, force_team_add=True)
    >>> dirk = new_person('Dirk')
    >>> dirk.join(team_two)
    >>> dirk.join(team_three)
    >>> list_one.subscribe(dirk)
    >>> list_three.subscribe(dirk)
    >>> sorted(email.email for email in list_one.getSubscribedAddresses())
    [u'anne.person@example.com', u'bperson@example.org',
     u'cris.person@example.com', u'dirk.person@example.com']
    >>> sorted(email.email for email in list_three.getSubscribedAddresses())
    [u'dirk.person@example.com']

Once the subteam is deactivated from the superteam, subteam members who have
no other indirect membership in the superteam will be unsubscribed to the
superteam's mailing list.

    >>> dirk.leave(team_two)
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import TeamMembershipStatus
    >>> team_one.setMembershipData(team_three,
    ...     TeamMembershipStatus.DEACTIVATED, salgado)
    >>> sorted(email.email for email in list_one.getSubscribedAddresses())
    [u'anne.person@example.com', u'bperson@example.org',
     u'cris.person@example.com']

However, their mail-list settings for the super-team will remain via a
MailingListSubscription object.

    >>> print list_one.getSubscription(dirk)
    <security ...MailingListSubscription instance ...>


Sub-team members may still ask to subscribe to the super-team's list,
but their subscription will not become active, as they are not an
approved member of the super-team.

    # This will raise an error because the subscription object
    # already exists.  However, the UI should have taken this into
    # account.
    >>> list_one.subscribe(dirk)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    CannotSubscribe: Dirk Person is already subscribed to list Team One

    >>> sorted(email.email for email in list_one.getSubscribedAddresses())
    [u'anne.person@example.com', u'bperson@example.org',
     u'cris.person@example.com']


Teams, even subteams, cannot subscribe to mailing lists.

    >>> list_one.subscribe(team_two)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    CannotSubscribe: Teams cannot be mailing list members: Team Two


== Subscribed email addresses ==

As shown above, a person can subscribe either with their preferred email
address or any other email address they own.  If they choose to use their
preferred email address, this will automatically track changes to their
preferred address.

    >>> elle = new_person('Elle')
    >>> elle.preferredemail.email
    u'elle.person@example.com'
    >>> elle_alternative = get_alternative_email(elle)
    >>> elle_alternative.email
    u'eperson@example.org'
    >>> team_four, list_four = new_team('team-four', with_list=True)
    >>> elle.join(team_four)
    >>> list_four.subscribe(elle)
    >>> sorted(email.email for email in list_four.getSubscribedAddresses())
    [u'elle.person@example.com']
    >>> elle.setPreferredEmail(elle_alternative)
    >>> sorted(email.email for email in list_four.getSubscribedAddresses())
    [u'eperson@example.org']

A person cannot subscribe an email address they do not own.

    >>> fred = new_person('Fred')
    >>> anne.join(team_four)
    >>> list_four.subscribe(anne, fred.preferredemail)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    CannotSubscribe: Anne Person does not own the email address:
        fred.person@example.com


== Unsubscribing ==

Any list member can unsubscribe from the mailing list.

    >>> sorted(email.email for email in list_one.getSubscribedAddresses())
    [u'anne.person@example.com', u'bperson@example.org',
     u'cris.person@example.com']
    >>> list_one.unsubscribe(anne)
    >>> sorted(email.email for email in list_one.getSubscribedAddresses())
    [u'bperson@example.org', u'cris.person@example.com']

But someone who is not a member cannot unsubscribe.

    >>> list_one.unsubscribe(fred)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    CannotUnsubscribe: Fred Person is not a member of the mailing list:
        Team One

When someone leaves a direct team, they automatically get unsubscribed.

    >>> bart.leave(team_one)
    >>> sorted(email.email for email in list_one.getSubscribedAddresses())
    [u'cris.person@example.com']

When the person re-joins a team that gives them indirect membership in a team
with a mailing list that they were previously subscribed to, they get
re-subscribed to that mailing list automatically.  See the section on
persistence of preferences below for more examples of this.

    >>> bart.join(team_two)
    >>> sorted(email.email for email in list_one.getSubscribedAddresses())
    [u'bperson@example.org', u'cris.person@example.com']

When someone is a member of a mailing list through an indirect team, and they
leave that indirect team, they also get unsubscribed from the mailing list.

    >>> cris.leave(team_two)
    >>> sorted(email.email for email in list_one.getSubscribedAddresses())
    [u'bperson@example.org']

It's also the case that if a subteam leaves its superteam, all members who
have no other indirect membership in the super team will get unsubscribed from
the mailing list.  To illustrate, we set up a new subteam and join a few new
members to that team.  Only Iona will have a path to the superteam through
more than one subteam.

    >>> team_five = new_team('team-five')
    >>> team_one.addMember(team_five, salgado, force_team_add=True)
    >>> gwen = new_person('Gwen')
    >>> hank = new_person('Hank')
    >>> iona = new_person('Iona')

    >>> gwen.join(team_five)
    >>> hank.join(team_five)
    >>> iona.join(team_five)
    >>> iona.join(team_two)

    >>> sorted(email.email for email in list_one.getSubscribedAddresses())
    [u'bperson@example.org']

    >>> list_one.subscribe(gwen)
    >>> list_one.subscribe(hank)
    >>> list_one.subscribe(iona)

    >>> sorted(email.email for email in list_one.getSubscribedAddresses())
    [u'bperson@example.org', u'gwen.person@example.com',
     u'hank.person@example.com', u'iona.person@example.com']

Now remove one of the subteams from the superteam.  All of the subteams'
members that have no other path to membership in the superteam will be
unsubscribed from the superteam's mailing list.

    >>> team_one.setMembershipData(team_five,
    ...     TeamMembershipStatus.DEACTIVATED, salgado)
    >>> sorted(email.email for email in list_one.getSubscribedAddresses())
    [u'bperson@example.org', u'iona.person@example.com']


== Double subscriptions ==

A list member may only be subscribed once, with a single email address.

    >>> list_one.subscribe(iona)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    CannotSubscribe: Iona Person is already subscribed to list Team One

A current subscriber is not even allowed to subscribe multiple times with a
different email address.

    >>> iona_alternative = get_alternative_email(iona)
    >>> list_one.subscribe(iona, iona_alternative)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    CannotSubscribe: Iona Person is already subscribed to list Team One


== List deactivation ==

When a team's mailing list is deactivated, all subscriptions to that mailing
list are dropped.

    >>> sorted(email.email for email in list_one.getSubscribedAddresses())
    [u'bperson@example.org', u'iona.person@example.com']

    # Deactivation isn't complete until the list's status is transitioned to
    # INACTIVE.
    >>> list_one.deactivate()
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import MailingListStatus
    >>> list_one.transitionToStatus(MailingListStatus.INACTIVE)
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests import sync
    >>> sync(list_one)
    >>> sorted(email.email for email in list_one.getSubscribedAddresses())
    []

A list that is not active cannot be subscribed to.

    >>> list_one.subscribe(anne)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    CannotSubscribe: Mailing list is not usable: Team One


== Persistence of preferences ==

When someone gets unsubscribed because they leave a team, their subscription
preferences are preserved, so that if they re-join the team, their
subscription gets re-instated.  Currently, the subscribed email address is the
only relevant preference.

    >>> team_six, list_six = new_team('team-six', with_list=True)
    >>> jack = new_person('Jack')
    >>> jack.join(team_six)
    >>> list_six.subscribe(jack)
    >>> sorted(email.email for email in list_six.getSubscribedAddresses())
    [u'jack.person@example.com']
    >>> jack.leave(team_six)
    >>> sorted(email.email for email in list_six.getSubscribedAddresses())
    []
    >>> jack.join(team_six)
    >>> sorted(email.email for email in list_six.getSubscribedAddresses())
    [u'jack.person@example.com']

This is true even if they subscribe with an address that's different than
their preferred email address.

    >>> kara = new_person('Kara')
    >>> kara.join(team_six)
    >>> kara_alternative = get_alternative_email(kara)
    >>> kara_alternative.email
    u'kperson@example.org'
    >>> list_six.subscribe(kara, kara_alternative)
    >>> sorted(email.email for email in list_six.getSubscribedAddresses())
    [u'jack.person@example.com', u'kperson@example.org']
    >>> kara.leave(team_six)
    >>> sorted(email.email for email in list_six.getSubscribedAddresses())
    [u'jack.person@example.com']
    >>> kara.join(team_six)
    >>> sorted(email.email for email in list_six.getSubscribedAddresses())
    [u'jack.person@example.com', u'kperson@example.org']


== Changing subscribed email address ==

A member of a mailing list can request to change certain aspects of their
subscription.  Currently the only thing they can change is their subscribed
address.  Let's say for example that Kara wants to change the address that
she is subscribed to List Six with.

    >>> list_six.unsubscribe(jack)
    >>> for address in address_set.getByPerson(kara):
    ...     list_six.changeAddress(kara, address)
    ...     flush_database_updates()
    ...     print address.email, sorted(
    ...         email.email for email in list_six.getSubscribedAddresses())
    kara.person@example.com [u'kara.person@example.com']
    kperson@example.org [u'kperson@example.org']

Kara can also change her email address to None, which uses and tracks any
changes to her preferred email address.

    >>> list_six.changeAddress(kara, None)
    >>> flush_database_updates()
    >>> sorted(email.email for email in list_six.getSubscribedAddresses())
    [u'kara.person@example.com']
    >>> for address in address_set.getByPerson(kara):
    ...     kara.setPreferredEmail(address)
    ...     flush_database_updates()
    ...     print address.email, sorted(
    ...         email.email for email in list_six.getSubscribedAddresses())
    kara.person@example.com [u'kara.person@example.com']
    kperson@example.org [u'kperson@example.org']

Kara cannot change her email address to one she does not own.

    >>> list_six.changeAddress(kara, fred.preferredemail)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    CannotChangeSubscription: Kara Person does not own the email address:
        fred.person@example.com

Someone who is not a member of the mailing list of course cannot change their
subscription address.

    >>> list_six.changeAddress(anne, None)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    CannotChangeSubscription: Anne Person is not a member of
        the mailing list: Team Six


== Subscribing while requesting a team membership ==

Someone who is not a member of a team may subscribe to the team's
mailing list.  Full membership is only required to post to or receive
emails from it.

    >>> team_seven, list_seven = new_team('team-7', with_list=True)
    >>> sam = new_person('Samuel')

    >>> list_seven.subscribe(sam)
    >>> sorted(email.email for email in list_seven.getSubscribedAddresses())
    []

Samuel may not post to the mailing list using any of his addresses.

    >>> sorted(email.email for email in list_seven.getSenderAddresses())
    []

Samuel will have a corresponding subscription object in the database,
but his subscription will not be fully active or visible until
his team membership is approved.

    >>> print list_seven.getSubscription(sam)
    <security ...MailingListSubscription instance ...>

    >>> sorted(email.email for email in list_seven.getSubscribedAddresses())
    []
    >>> sorted(email.email for email in list_seven.getSenderAddresses())
    []

    >>> sam.join(team_seven)
    >>> sorted(email.email for email in list_seven.getSubscribedAddresses())
    [u'samuel.person@example.com']
    >>> sorted(email.email for email in list_seven.getSenderAddresses())
    [u'samuel.person@example.com', u'sperson@example.org']


== Deleting addresses ==

When a user deletes an email address, all of their mailing list
subscriptions that use that address are automatically deleted as well.

    >>> list_six.changeAddress(kara, kara_alternative)
    >>> flush_database_updates()
    >>> print sorted(email.email
    ...              for email in list_six.getSubscribedAddresses())
    [u'kperson@example.org']

    >>> kara_alternative.destroySelf()
    >>> print sorted(email.email
    ...              for email in list_six.getSubscribedAddresses())
    []


== Subscription states ==

A user can subscribe to a mailing list only when the list is active (as
show above), but for purposes of subscription, we also consider lists in
the MODIFIED, UPDATING, and MOD_FAILED states to be active.  This is
because the first two states are transitional states, while the latter
state does not affect the usability of the mailing list.  Thus, if the
mailing list is usable, then it can be subscribed to.  See above also
for states in which the list /cannot/ be subscribed to, such as the
DEACTIVATED state.

    >>> team_eight, list_eight = new_team('team-8', with_list=True)
    >>> teri = new_person('Teri')
    >>> teri.join(team_seven)

    # We don't need to test the ACTIVE state, as that's represented above.
    # However, because 'status' is a protected attribute, we need to unwrap
    # the security context in order to set it.
    >>> from zope.security.proxy import removeSecurityProxy
    >>> removeSecurityProxy(list_seven).status = MailingListStatus.MODIFIED
    >>> syncUpdate(list_seven)
    >>> list_seven.subscribe(teri)
    >>> list_seven.unsubscribe(teri)

    >>> removeSecurityProxy(list_seven).status = MailingListStatus.UPDATING
    >>> syncUpdate(list_seven)
    >>> list_seven.subscribe(teri)
    >>> list_seven.unsubscribe(teri)

    >>> removeSecurityProxy(list_seven).status = MailingListStatus.MOD_FAILED
    >>> syncUpdate(list_seven)
    >>> list_seven.subscribe(teri)
    >>> list_seven.unsubscribe(teri)

But in other, non-usable states, the mailing list cannot be subscribed
to.

    # We don't need to test the INACTIVE state, as that's represented above.
    >>> removeSecurityProxy(list_seven).status = MailingListStatus.REGISTERED
    >>> syncUpdate(list_seven)
    >>> list_seven.subscribe(teri)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    CannotSubscribe: Mailing list is not usable: Team 7

    >>> removeSecurityProxy(list_seven).status = MailingListStatus.APPROVED
    >>> syncUpdate(list_seven)
    >>> list_seven.subscribe(teri)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    CannotSubscribe: Mailing list is not usable: Team 7

    >>> removeSecurityProxy(list_seven).status = MailingListStatus.DECLINED
    >>> syncUpdate(list_seven)
    >>> list_seven.subscribe(teri)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    CannotSubscribe: Mailing list is not usable: Team 7

    >>> removeSecurityProxy(list_seven).status = MailingListStatus.CONSTRUCTING
    >>> syncUpdate(list_seven)
    >>> list_seven.subscribe(teri)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    CannotSubscribe: Mailing list is not usable: Team 7

    >>> removeSecurityProxy(list_seven).status = MailingListStatus.FAILED
    >>> syncUpdate(list_seven)
    >>> list_seven.subscribe(teri)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    CannotSubscribe: Mailing list is not usable: Team 7

    >>> removeSecurityProxy(list_seven).status = (
    ...     MailingListStatus.DEACTIVATING)
    >>> syncUpdate(list_seven)
    >>> list_seven.subscribe(teri)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    CannotSubscribe: Mailing list is not usable: Team 7


== Subscribing a person to a list gracefully ==

Calling IMailingList.subscribe() directly will always subscribe a
person, regardless of their mailing list auto-subscription settings,
and raise errors if there are any problems.  Calling
IPerson.subscribeToMailingList() will take these settings into account
and try to recover gracefully from errors.  The method will return a
True or False value to indicate if the user was subscribed to the list.

    >>> team_eight, list_eight = new_team('team-eight', with_list=True)
    >>> mary = new_person('Mary', use_default_autosubscribe_policy=True)

Mary is not a member of list-eight, so she will have no problem joining.

    >>> mary.subscribeToMailingList(list_eight)
    True
    >>> print list_eight.getSubscription(mary)
    <security ...MailingListSubscription instance ...>

Subscribing a second time will fail.

    >>> mary.subscribeToMailingList(list_eight)
    False

Subscribing to an inactive list fails.

    >>> team_off, list_off = new_team('team-off', with_list=True)
    >>> list_off.deactivate()
    >>> list_off.isUsable()
    False

    >>> mary.subscribeToMailingList(list_off)
    False

If a team's mailing list is non-existant, then the method will try to
recover gracefully.

    >>> team_sans_list = new_team('sans-list', with_list=False)
    >>> mary.subscribeToMailingList(team_sans_list.mailing_list)
    False


And we can't subscribe someone who does not have a preferred email address.

    >>> qbert = new_person('Qbert', set_preferred_email=False,
    ...                    use_default_autosubscribe_policy=True)
    >>> print qbert.preferredemail
    None

    >>> qbert.subscribeToMailingList(list_eight)
    False


=== Auto-subscription policy settings ===

Mary's auto-subscription settings are taken into account when signing
up for the list.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces.mailinglistsubscription import (
    ...     MailingListAutoSubscribePolicy)
    >>> ALWAYS = MailingListAutoSubscribePolicy.ALWAYS
    >>> ON_REGISTRATION = MailingListAutoSubscribePolicy.ON_REGISTRATION
    >>> NEVER = MailingListAutoSubscribePolicy.NEVER

By default, new users have a policy to only join a list if they
explicitly request it.  If someone else adds them to a list, then they
are only subscribed to the list if their policy is set to 'ALWAYS'.

    >>> kathy = new_person('Kathy', use_default_autosubscribe_policy=True)
    >>> kathy.mailing_list_auto_subscribe_policy
    <...ON_REGISTRATION...>

    >>> kathy.subscribeToMailingList(list_eight, requester=mary)
    False

    >>> kathy.mailing_list_auto_subscribe_policy = ALWAYS
    >>> kathy.subscribeToMailingList(list_eight, requester=mary)
    True

Setting the policy to NEVER should be self-explanatory.

    >>> norbert = new_person('Norbert')
    >>> norbert.mailing_list_auto_subscribe_policy = NEVER
    >>> norbert.subscribeToMailingList(list_eight)
    False
