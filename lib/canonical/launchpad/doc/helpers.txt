= Helper Functions and Classes =

There are some helper functions and classes located in
canonical.launchpad.helpers which can be used in order to avoid
duplicating code in different parts of Launchpad.


== Concatenating lists English-style ==

The english_list function takes a list of strings and concatenates
them in a form suitable for inclusion in an English sentence. For
lists of 3 or more elements it follows the advice given in The
Elements of Style, chapter I, section 2.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.helpers import english_list

By default, it joins the last two elements in the list with 'and', and
joins the rest of the list with ','. It also adds whitespace around
these delimiters as appropriate.

    >>> english_list([])
    ''
    >>> english_list(['Fred'])
    'Fred'
    >>> english_list(['Fred', 'Bob'])
    'Fred and Bob'
    >>> english_list(['Fred', 'Bob', 'Harold'])
    'Fred, Bob, and Harold'

It accepts any iterable that yields strings:

    >>> english_list('12345')
    '1, 2, 3, 4, and 5'
    >>> english_list(str(i) for i in xrange(5))
    '0, 1, 2, 3, and 4'

It does not convert non-string elements:

    >>> english_list(range(3))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TypeError: sequence item 0: expected string, int found

The conjunction can be changed:

    >>> english_list('123', 'or')
    '1, 2, or 3'


== get_contact_email_addresses ==

The get_contact_email_addresses function is used to get a person's preferred
address as a set for function that require the a set of email addresses.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.helpers import get_contact_email_addresses

    >>> user = factory.makePerson(
    ...     email='user@canonical.com',
    ...     name='user',)
    >>> get_contact_email_addresses(user)
    set(['user@canonical.com'])
