Bazaar Revisions
================

Branches are collection of revisions, and a revision can exist independently
from any branch. Revisions are created automatically by scanning branches, they
have no creation interface and Launchpad cannot create or modify them.

Creating revisions
------------------

Revisions have an owner attribute. I do not think that is useful at all, but
Mark wants to keep that around. As a convention, the owner of a Revision is
always the Launchpad Admins team.

>>> from canonical.launchpad.database import Person
>>> admins = Person.selectOneBy(name='admins')

The creator of a revision is identified by a RevisionAuthor. A RevisionAutor is
not a person because that is only an informational attribute, and even if we
trust it, there's really no simple way to map that reliably to persons.

>>> from canonical.launchpad.database import RevisionAuthor
>>> author = RevisionAuthor(name='ddaa@localhost')
>>> author.name
u'ddaa@localhost'

The log-body of a revision is the commit message of that revision.

>>> log_body_1 = "Initial import"
>>> log_body_2 = "Fix froboizer"

The revision-id is the globally unique id used by the revision control. For
native Bazaar2 revisions it's a GUID, for Bazaar2 imports it's a string based
on the Arch revision id.

>>> revision_id_1 = "Arch-1:ddaa@example.com/junk--devel--base-0"
>>> revision_id_2 = "some random unique string, we do not care, really"

The revision_date is the commit date recorded by the revision control system,
while the date_created is the time when the database record was created.

>>> from datetime import datetime
>>> from pytz import UTC
>>> date = datetime(2005, 3, 8, 12, 0, tzinfo=UTC)
>>> from canonical.launchpad.database import Revision
>>> revision_1 = Revision(owner=admins, log_body=log_body_1,
...     revision_author=author, revision_id=revision_id_1, revision_date=date)

Ancestors
---------

Bazaar revisions can have multiple ancestors, the "leftmost" ancestor is the
revision that was used as a base when committing, other ancestors are used to
record merges. All revisions except initial imports have at least one ancestor.

Ancestors are accessed through their revision_id without using a foreign key so
we can represent revision whose at least one ancestor is a ghost revision.

>>> revision_2 = Revision(owner=admins, log_body=log_body_2,
...     revision_author=author, revision_id=revision_id_2, revision_date=date)

>>> from canonical.launchpad.database import RevisionParent
>>> rev2_parent = RevisionParent(sequence=0, revision=revision_2,
...                              parent_id=revision_1.revision_id)

Revision numbers
----------------

Revisions are associated to branches through the RevisionNumber table. A given
revision may appear in different positions in different branches thanks to
Bazaar2 converge-on-pull logic.

>>> from canonical.launchpad.database import Branch
>>> branch = Branch.get(1)
>>> branch.revision_history
[] 

RevisionNumber does not have a creation interface, like for Revision, new
records are only created by a non-zope batch job.

>>> from canonical.launchpad.database import RevisionNumber
>>> junkcode_sql = Branch.selectOneBy(name='junkcode')
>>> rev_no_1 = RevisionNumber(sequence=1, branch=branch, revision=revision_1)
>>> rev_no_2 = RevisionNumber(sequence=2, branch=branch, revision=revision_2)
>>> rev_no_1.branch == rev_no_2.branch == branch
True
