ProductSeries
=============

A Launchpad Product models a single piece of software. However for release
management purposes, a Product often has to be split in several discrete
entities which must be considered separately for packaging, translations,
version control, etc. We call these entities ProductSeries.

>>> from zope.component import getUtility
>>> from zope.interface.verify import verifyObject
>>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import (
...     IProductSeries, IProductSet, NotFoundError)
>>> from canonical.database.sqlbase import flush_database_updates

First, get a product that has some ProductSeries in the sample data.

>>> productset = getUtility(IProductSet)
>>> firefox = productset['firefox']

A ProductSeries can be retrieved using the associated product and the series name.

>>> milestones = firefox.getSeries('milestones')

Verify that the resulting object correctly implements the IProductSeries
interface.

>>> verifyObject(IProductSeries, milestones)
True

And verify that it looks like the series we think it should be.

>>> milestones.product == firefox
True
>>> milestones.name
u'milestones'

It's also possible to ask a product for all its associated series.

>>> onedotzero = firefox.getSeries('1.0')
>>> series = firefox.serieslist
>>> series == [onedotzero, milestones]
True

New ProductSeries are created using Product.newSeries.

>>> displayname = "Firefox Emacs Port"
>>> summary = "Experimental port of Firefox to the Emacs operating system."
>>> emacs = firefox.newSeries('emacs', displayname, summary)

Let's check that the new series is properly associated to its product.

>>> flush_database_updates()
>>> firefox.getSeries('emacs') == emacs
True
