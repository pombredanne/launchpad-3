  * Run process-upload.py
  * Check result
  * Mark packages as ACCEPTED
  * Runs process-accepted.py
  * Check results
  * Cleanup


Uploading Packages
------------------


First, let's create a temporary directory where we'll put
uploaded files in.

  >>> import os
  >>> import tempfile
  >>> temp_dir = tempfile.mkdtemp()
  >>> incoming_dir = os.path.join(temp_dir, "incoming")
  >>> accepted_dir = os.path.join(temp_dir, "accepted")
  >>> rejected_dir = os.path.join(temp_dir, "rejected")
  >>> failed_dir = os.path.join(temp_dir, "failed")
  >>> os.mkdir(incoming_dir)


Now, let's create a subprocess running the poppy FTP server. It won't
call the upload processing tool. We'll do that ourselves in our test,
so that we can control what's going on.

  >>> from canonical.poppy.tests import (
  ...     PoppyTestSetup, SoyuzUploadError)
  >>> poppy = PoppyTestSetup(incoming_dir)
  >>> poppy.startPoppy()

Connect to the server and login. We'll keep trying to connect until
the server dies or the connection succeeds.

  >>> import ftplib, socket
  >>> ftp = ftplib.FTP()
  >>> while True:
  ...    try:
  ...        reply = ftp.connect("localhost", 3421)
  ...    except socket.error:
  ...        if not poppy.alive:
  ...            raise SoyuzUploadError('Server can not start.')
  ...    else:
  ...        break
  >>> ftp.login("anonymous", "")
  '230 Login Successful.'
  >>> ftp.cwd("/")
  '250 CWD command successful.'


Good.. let's send all packages we have in the test directory to
the poppy server. We send each package set on a different ftp
session.

  >>> from canonical.archiveuploader.tagfiles import parse_tagfile
  >>> from canonical.config import config
  >>> from cStringIO import StringIO
  >>> import glob
  >>> import time
  >>>
  >>> test_files_dir = os.path.join(config.root,
  ...                               "lib/canonical/launchpad/scripts/"
  ...                               "ftests/upload_test_files/")
  ...
  >>> changes = sorted(glob.glob(test_files_dir + "*.changes"))
  >>> sent_filenames = []
  >>> uploads = []
  >>> package_names = []
  >>>

  # XXX cprov 2006-01-25 Bug=29645: poppy still having a weird behaviour
  # during the file transfer, it suddenly closes the connection due
  # inactivity. That's why we keep polling the 'ftp.sock' attribute and
  # reconnect if it is gone.

  >>> for changes_filepath in changes:
  ...
  ...     if not ftp.sock:
  ...         assert ftp.connect("localhost", 3421).startswith("220 ")
  ...         assert ftp.login("anonymous", "") == '230 Login Successful.'
  ...
  ...     tf = parse_tagfile(changes_filepath)
  ...
  ...     if tf.has_key("source"):
  ...         package_names.append(tf["source"])
  ...
  ...     send_filepaths = [changes_filepath]
  ...     if tf.has_key("files"):
  ...         send_filepaths.extend(
  ...             [os.path.join(test_files_dir, line.split()[-1])
  ...              for line in tf["files"].splitlines() if line])
  ...
  ...     sent_filenames.extend(
  ...         os.path.basename(filepath) for filepath in send_filepaths)
  ...
  ...     ignore = ftp.cwd("ubuntutest")
  ...
  ...     for filepath in send_filepaths:
  ...         reply = ftp.storbinary(
  ...              "STOR %s" % os.path.basename(filepath), open(filepath))
  ...         assert reply == '226 Transfer successful.'
  ...
  ...     uploads.append(send_filepaths)
  ...
  ...     assert ftp.quit() == '221 Goodbye.'

Check that what we've just uploaded (everything in test_files_dir) is
what we were expecting to have uploaded.

  >>> package_names
  ['drdsl', 'etherwake']

We create a set of the filenames we expect to see in the FTP server
process output, and wait until all of them have been shown.

This is a little bit tricky because we won't simply try to read
the process output in a blocking way, since any failure in the
FTP process would block automated tests. Instead, we define a
timeout between output data. If the process doesn't provide new
data in the given number seconds, we report a failure.

  >>> poppy.verify_output(
  ...     ['ubuntutest', 'ubuntutest', 'ubuntutest'])

At that point we must have a bunch of directories in the upload
base directory named <TIMESTAMP>-XXXXXX, each one as a result of
each FTP session. Below we ensure that, and also that the content
of these files match the uploaded ones.

  >>> import md5
  >>> def get_md5(filename):
  ...     return md5.new(open(filename).read()).digest()

  >>> def get_upload_dir(num, dir=incoming_dir):
  ...     """Return the path to the upload, if found in the dir."""
  ...     for upload_dir in os.listdir(dir):
  ...         if upload_dir.endswith("%06d" % num):
  ...             return os.path.join(dir, upload_dir)
  ...     return None

  >>> def find_upload_dir(num):
  ...     """Return a tuple (result, path) for the numbered upload."""
  ...     for name, dir in (("incoming", incoming_dir),
  ...         ("accepted", accepted_dir), ("rejected", rejected_dir),
  ...         ("failed", failed_dir)):
  ...         result = get_upload_dir(num, dir)
  ...         if result is not None:
  ...             return (name, result)
  ...     return (None, None)

  >>> def find_upload_dir_result(num):
  ...     """Return the result for the numbered upload."""
  ...     return find_upload_dir(num)[0]

  >>> def find_upload_dir_path(num):
  ...     """Return the path of the numbered upload."""
  ...     return find_upload_dir(num)[1]

  >>> for i, sent_filenames in enumerate(uploads):
  ...     upload_dir = get_upload_dir(i + 1)
  ...     distro_upload_dir = os.path.join(upload_dir, 'ubuntutest')
  ...     assert len(os.listdir(distro_upload_dir)) == len(sent_filenames)
  ...     for filename in sent_filenames:
  ...         upload_filename = os.path.join(distro_upload_dir,
  ...                                        os.path.basename(filename))
  ...         assert os.path.isfile(upload_filename)
  ...         assert get_md5(filename) == get_md5(upload_filename)


Right, that's all we need from the FTP server. We don't need it anymore,
so we'll just kill the process.

  >>> status = poppy.killPoppy()

Finally, we'll just create an entirely empty upload folder. We rely for
our tests on a poppy-like naming system, ie. that the upload folder
end with 000004 (being our fourth upload).

  >>> os.mkdir("%s/fake_upload_000004" % incoming_dir)


Processing Uploads
------------------

Before asking the system to process the upload, we must prepare the
database to receive it. This consists mainly of adding the katie
user, since that's the email used in the Changed-By field for the
.changes files we are going to process, and the ftpmaster@canonical.com
GPG key, since that's the one used to sign the .changes file.

We don't have to check the .dsc file, since we're using the 'sync'
policy in process-upload.py.

# XXX: gustavo 2005-12-10
#     It might be interesting to move these entries into the sample data
#     rather than leaving it here. On the other hand, it's nice to have
#     it here as we have a good reference of what the uploading
#     procedure depends upon.

So, load the GPG key:

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests.keys_for_tests import gpgkeysdir
  >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IGPGHandler
  >>> from zope.component import getUtility
  >>> gpg_handler = getUtility(IGPGHandler)
  >>> key_path = os.path.join(gpgkeysdir, 'ftpmaster@canonical.com.pub')
  >>> key_data = open(key_path).read()
  >>> key = gpg_handler.importPublicKey(key_data)
  >>> assert key is not None
  >>> key.fingerprint
  '33C0A61893A5DC5EB325B29E415A12CAC2F30234'


Create the katie user and register it in a team that is allowed to
do uploads:

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import (
  ...     IPersonSet, IEmailAddressSet, PersonCreationRationale, IGPGKeySet,
  ...     GPGKeyAlgorithm)
  >>> name, address = "Katie", "katie@rockhopper.ubuntu.com"
  >>> user = getUtility(IPersonSet).ensurePerson(
  ...     address, name, PersonCreationRationale.OWNER_CREATED_LAUNCHPAD)
  >>> assert user is not None
  >>> email = getUtility(IEmailAddressSet).getByEmail(address)
  >>> user.validateAndEnsurePreferredEmail(email)

  >>> uploader_team = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName("ubuntu-team")
  >>> assert uploader_team is not None

  >>> uploader_team.addMember(user, reviewer=uploader_team.teamowner)


Assign the loaded GPG key to the katie user.

  >>> key_set = getUtility(IGPGKeySet)
  >>> user_key = key_set.new(ownerID=user.id, keyid=key.keyid,
  ...                        fingerprint=key.fingerprint,
  ...                        algorithm=GPGKeyAlgorithm.items[key.algorithm],
  ...                        keysize=key.keysize, can_encrypt=key.can_encrypt,
  ...                        active=True)


Now we want to turn on the zeca key server to provide the key we
just imported. Remember that process-upload.py is running as
a different process.

  >>> from canonical.zeca.ftests.harness import ZecaTestSetup
  >>> ZecaTestSetup().setUp()


Include non-free in the database. This will be done by the
NascentUpload in the 'sync' policy in the future.

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IComponentSet
  >>> component_set = getUtility(IComponentSet)
  >>> non_free = component_set.new("non-free")
  >>> contrib = component_set.new("contrib")
  >>> import transaction
  >>> transaction.commit()

Now we are ready to process the uploaded packages.
This is done by running process-upload.py on each upload directory.

  >>> import subprocess, sys
  >>> script = os.path.join(config.root, "scripts/process-upload.py")

First, we will test process-upload's -J option, which limits which uploads
should be processed. We'll do this by locating and uploading initially
just upload number 1.

  >>> upload_dir_1_path = get_upload_dir(1)
  >>> upload_dir_1_name = os.path.basename(upload_dir_1_path)
  >>> process = subprocess.Popen([sys.executable, script, "--no-mails", "-vv",
  ...                             "-C", "sync", "-J", upload_dir_1_name,
  ...                             temp_dir],
  ...                             stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
  ...                             stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
  >>> stdout, stderr = process.communicate()
  >>> process.returncode
  0

Check the four uploads are all where we expect - number 1 in failed,
the other three still in incoming.

  >>> for i in range(4):
  ...     find_upload_dir_result(i + 1)
  'failed'
  'incoming'
  'incoming'
  'incoming'


Now continue with the real upload.

  >>> process = subprocess.Popen([sys.executable, script, "--no-mails", "-vv",
  ...                             "-C", "sync", temp_dir],
  ...                             stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
  ...                             stderr=subprocess.PIPE)

  >>> stdout, stderr = process.communicate()
  >>> if process.returncode != 0:
  ...     print stdout
  ...     print stderr


Let's check if packages were uploaded correctly.

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import (
  ...     SourcePackageRelease, SourcePackageName)
  >>> from pprint import pprint
  >>> spn = SourcePackageName.selectOneBy(name="drdsl")
  >>> spn.name
  u'drdsl'
  >>> spr = SourcePackageRelease.selectOneBy(sourcepackagenameID=spn.id)
  >>> spr.title
  u'drdsl - 1.2.0-0ubuntu1'
  >>> spr.name
  u'drdsl'
  >>> spr.version
  u'1.2.0-0ubuntu1'
  >>> spr.component.name
  u'non-free'
  >>> spr.section.name
  u'comm'
  >>> spr.maintainer.displayname
  u'Matthias Klose'
  >>> pprint(sorted([sprf.libraryfile.filename for sprf in spr.files]))
  [u'drdsl_1.2.0-0ubuntu1.diff.gz',
   u'drdsl_1.2.0-0ubuntu1.dsc',
   u'drdsl_1.2.0.orig.tar.gz']
  >>> spr.format.name
  'DPKG'
  >>> spr.urgency.name
  'LOW'
  >>> spr.uploaddistroseries.name
  u'breezy-autotest'


Same thing for etherwake:

  >>> spn = SourcePackageName.selectOneBy(name="etherwake")
  >>> spn.name
  u'etherwake'
  >>> spr = SourcePackageRelease.selectOneBy(sourcepackagenameID=spn.id)
  >>> spr.title
  u'etherwake - 1.08-1'
  >>> spr.name
  u'etherwake'
  >>> spr.version
  u'1.08-1'
  >>> spr.component.name
  u'main'
  >>> spr.section.name
  u'net'
  >>> spr.maintainer.displayname
  u'Alain Schroeder'
  >>> pprint(sorted([sprf.libraryfile.filename for sprf in spr.files]))
  [u'etherwake_1.08-1.diff.gz',
   u'etherwake_1.08-1.dsc',
   u'etherwake_1.08.orig.tar.gz']
  >>> spr.format.name
  'DPKG'
  >>> spr.urgency.name
  'LOW'
  >>> spr.uploaddistroseries.name
  u'breezy-autotest'


Check the four uploads all ended up where we expected.

  >>> for i in range(0, 4):
  ...     find_upload_dir_result(i + 1)
  'failed'
  'accepted'
  'accepted'
  'failed'

Also check the upload folders contain all the files we uploaded.

# XXX cprov 2006-12-06: hardcoded 'ubuntutest' directory is a hack see
# above around line 313.

  >>> for i, sent_filenames in enumerate(uploads):
  ...     upload_dir = find_upload_dir_path( i + 1)
  ...     distro_upload_dir = os.path.join(upload_dir, 'ubuntutest')
  ...     assert len(os.listdir(distro_upload_dir)) == len(sent_filenames)
  ...     for filename in sent_filenames:
  ...         upload_filename = os.path.join(distro_upload_dir,
  ...                                        os.path.basename(filename))
  ...         assert os.path.isfile(upload_filename)
  ...         assert get_md5(filename) == get_md5(upload_filename)


Now let's see if all of the valid uploads are in the Upload queue marked
as NEW and RELEASE.

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import PackageUploadSource
  >>> for name in package_names:
  ...     print name
  ...     spn = SourcePackageName.selectOneBy(name=name)
  ...     spr = SourcePackageRelease.selectOneBy(sourcepackagenameID=spn.id)
  ...     us = PackageUploadSource.selectOneBy(sourcepackagereleaseID=spr.id)
  ...     assert us.packageupload.status.name == 'NEW'
  ...     assert us.packageupload.pocket.name == 'RELEASE'
  drdsl
  etherwake


Processing NEW Items
----------------------

The processing of NEW-queue-entries checks the integrity of uploads
candidates and promote them to ACCEPTED, the failures are kept
as NEW

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import (
  ...     IDistributionSet, QueueInconsistentStateError)
  >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import PackageUploadStatus

Since we landed correct security adapters for Upload,
we need to perform further actions logged in as an admins, which have
launchpad.Edit on the records:

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests import login
  >>> login("foo.bar@canonical.com")

  >>> distro = getUtility(IDistributionSet).getByName('ubuntutest')
  >>> series = distro['breezy-autotest']

Let's test IHasQueueItems.getQueueItems:

  >>> new_items = series.getQueueItems(PackageUploadStatus.NEW)
  >>> new_items.count()
  2

Querying by status and a name term:

  >>> items = series.getQueueItems(PackageUploadStatus.NEW,
  ...                                    name='dr')
  >>> items.count()
  1

  >>> items[0].sources[0].sourcepackagerelease.name
  u'drdsl'
  >>> items[0].sources[0].sourcepackagerelease.version
  u'1.2.0-0ubuntu1'

Querying by status, name and version terms:

  >>> items = series.getQueueItems(PackageUploadStatus.NEW,
  ...                               name='dr', version='1.2')
  >>> items.count()
  1

  >>> items = series.getQueueItems(PackageUploadStatus.NEW,
  ...                               name='dr', version='1.5')
  >>> items.count()
  0

Using exact_match argument:

As you can see exact_match arguments affects both, name & version:

# XXX cprov 2006-01-25 bug=29642:
# Andrew suggest we can split the exact_match
# attribute in two, as exact_name & exact_version, which might be
# a good idea, since it produce a more controllable behaviour.

  >>> items = series.getQueueItems(PackageUploadStatus.NEW,
  ...                      name='dr', version='1.2', exact_match=True)
  >>> items.count()
  0

  >>> items = series.getQueueItems(PackageUploadStatus.NEW,
  ...          name='drdsl', version='1.2.0-0ubuntu1', exact_match=True)
  >>> items.count()
  1

Using getQueueItem to inspect current NEW queue and accept them.

  >>> queue_items = series.getQueueItems(PackageUploadStatus.NEW)
  >>> L = []
  >>> for queue_item in queue_items:
  ...      try:
  ...          queue_item.setAccepted()
  ...      except QueueInconsistentStateError, e:
  ...          L.append("%s %s" % (queue_item.sourcepackagerelease.name, e))
  ...      else:
  ...          L.append("%s %s" % (queue_item.sourcepackagerelease.name,
  ...                              'ACCEPTED'))
  >>> L.sort()
  >>> print "\n".join(L)
  drdsl Component "non-free" is not allowed in breezy-autotest
  etherwake ACCEPTED

# XXX cprov 2006-04-12 bug=3989:
# We must flush these changes so that it gets out of
# the cache and  into the database. Without this process-accepted.py
# wouldn't see the changes. Reported in

  >>> from canonical.database.sqlbase import flush_database_updates
  >>> flush_database_updates()
  >>> transaction.commit()


Now we process the accepted queue items, one more time.

  >>> script = os.path.join(config.root, "scripts", "process-accepted.py")
  >>> process = subprocess.Popen([sys.executable, script, "ubuntutest"])
  >>> process.wait()
  0

These packages must now be in the publishing history. Let's check it.

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import (
  ...    SecureSourcePackagePublishingHistory as SSPPH)
  >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import PackagePublishingStatus
  >>> package_names.sort()
  >>> for name in package_names:
  ...     spn = SourcePackageName.selectOneBy(name=name)
  ...     spr = SourcePackageRelease.selectOneBy(sourcepackagenameID=spn.id)
  ...     sspph = SSPPH.selectOneBy(sourcepackagereleaseID=spr.id)
  ...     if sspph:
  ...         print name, sspph.status.title
  ...     else:
  ...         print name, 'not Published'
  drdsl not Published
  etherwake Pending


Invoke Publisher script against the 'ubuntutest' distribution:

  >>> script = os.path.join(config.root, "scripts", "publish-distro.py")
  >>> process = subprocess.Popen([sys.executable, script, "-vvCq",
  ...                             "-d", "ubuntutest"],
  ...                            stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
  ...                            stderr=subprocess.PIPE)

  >>> flush_database_updates()

  >>> from canonical.database.sqlbase import clear_current_connection_cache

Check if the 'etherwake' source package was correctly published and is
in the filesystem archive, we are looking for the DSC, the gzipped
original source and the gzipped package diff:

  >>> len(os.listdir("/var/tmp/archive/ubuntutest/pool/main/e/etherwake"))
  3

Check the generation of a correct Sources tag file for the main
component of ubuntutest/breezy-autotest, containing the only the
required entry for 'etherwake':

  >>> script = os.path.join(config.root, "scripts", "publish-distro.py")
  >>> process = subprocess.Popen([sys.executable, script, "-vvCq",
  ...                             "-d", "ubuntutest"],
  ...                            stdout=subprocess.PIPE,

Check careful publishing took place, as requested with -C. In careful
publishing mode, publish-distro will attempt to publish files which are
already marked as published in the database and, if the files are
already on disk, verify the contents are as expected.

Check the publishing history again

  >>> for pub in SSPPH.selectBy(

Check if the package was moved properly to the component 'universe':

  >>> main_sources = open("/var/tmp/archive/ubuntutest/dists/breezy-autotest"
  ...                     "/main/source/Sources").read()
  >>> print main_sources + '\nEND'

  ...                         "Sources").read()
  >>> print universe_sources + '\nEND'

== Release File ==

The publish-distro.py script will write an appropriate Release file
containing the suite in question and a list of checksums (MD5, SHA1
and SHA256) for each index published.

# XXX cprov 2006-12-13: trailing space on Architectures is a side-effect
# caused by the absence of published binaries in this suite. It should
# no happen in real conditions.

  >>> releasefile_contents = open("/var/tmp/archive/ubuntutest/dists/"
  ...                             "breezy-autotest/Release").read()

Nice! That's enough for now.. let's kill the process and clean
everything up.

  >>> import shutil
  >>> shutil.rmtree(temp_dir)

Remove the test archive from filesystem.

  >>> shutil.rmtree("/var/tmp/archive/")
  >>> ZecaTestSetup().tearDown()


Feito! ;-)
