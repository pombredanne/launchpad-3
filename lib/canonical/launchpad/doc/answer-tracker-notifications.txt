= Answer Tracker Email Notifications =

When a question is created or changed, an email notification is sent out,
informing the subscribers and the answer contacts about the change.
Let's start with creating a question, and see what the resulting
notification looks like:

    >>> from zope.event import notify
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.event import SQLObjectCreatedEvent
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IDistributionSet
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.tests.mail_helpers import pop_notifications
    >>> login('test@canonical.com')
    >>> sample_person = getUtility(ILaunchBag).user
    >>> ubuntu = getUtility(IDistributionSet).getByName('ubuntu')
    >>> ubuntu_question = ubuntu.newQuestion(
    ...     sample_person, "Can't install Ubuntu",
    ...    "I insert the install CD in the CD-ROM drive, but it won't boot.")
    >>> notify(SQLObjectCreatedEvent(ubuntu_question))

The notifications get sent to the question's subscribers, the question's
target answer contacts as well as to the question's assignee. Initially,
only the submitter, Sample Person, is subscribed to the question and there
is no answer contact registered on Ubuntu, so only 1 notification is
sent:

    >>> ubuntu.answer_contacts
    []
    >>> [sub.person.displayname for sub in ubuntu_question.subscriptions]
    [u'Sample Person']
    >>> notifications = pop_notifications()
    >>> len(notifications)
    1

    >>> add_notification = notifications[0]
    >>> add_notification['From']
    'Sample Person <question...@answers.launchpad.net>'
    >>> add_notification['To']
    'test@canonical.com'
    >>> add_notification['Subject']
    "[Question #...]: Can't install Ubuntu"
    >>> notification_body = add_notification.get_payload()
    >>> print notification_body #doctest: -NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    New question #... on Ubuntu:
    http://.../ubuntu/+question/...
    <BLANKLINE>
    I insert the install CD in the CD-ROM drive, but it won't boot.
    <BLANKLINE>

The notification also includes a 'X-Launchpad-Question' header that
contains information about the question.

    >>> print add_notification['X-Launchpad-Question']
    distribution=ubuntu; sourcepackage=None; status=Open;
    assignee=None; priority=Normal; language=en

Register the Ubuntu Team as Ubuntu's answer contact, so that they get
notified about the changes as well:

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IPersonSet
    >>> ubuntu_team = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('ubuntu-team')
    >>> ubuntu.addAnswerContact(ubuntu_team)
    True

And assign this question to Foo Bar, so that he will also receive
notifications:

    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')
    >>> ubuntu_question.assignee = getUtility(ILaunchBag).user

== Edit Notifications ==

If we edit the title and description of the question, a notification will be
sent.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.event import SQLObjectModifiedEvent
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.webapp.snapshot import Snapshot
    >>> from zope.interface import providedBy

    >>> login('no-priv@canonical.com')
    >>> no_priv = getUtility(ILaunchBag).user
    >>> unmodified_question = Snapshot(
    ...     ubuntu_question, providing=providedBy(ubuntu_question))
    >>> ubuntu_question.title = "Installer doesn't work on a Mac"
    >>> ubuntu_question.description = """I insert the install CD in the CD-ROM
    ... drive, but it won't boot.
    ...
    ... It boots straight into MacOS 9."""
    >>> libstdcplusplus_sourcepackage = ubuntu.getSourcePackage('libstdc++')
    >>> ubuntu_question.target = libstdcplusplus_sourcepackage
    >>> notify(SQLObjectModifiedEvent(
    ...     ubuntu_question, unmodified_question, 
    ...     ['title', 'description', 'target']))

Three copies of the notification got sent, one to Sample Person, one to
Foo Bar, and one to Ubuntu Team:

    >>> from operator import itemgetter
    >>> notifications = sorted(pop_notifications(), key=itemgetter('To'))
    >>> [notification['To'] for notification in notifications]
    ['foo.bar@canonical.com', 'support@ubuntu.com', 'test@canonical.com']

    >>> edit_notification = notifications[0]
    >>> notification_body = edit_notification.get_payload(decode=True)
    >>> print edit_notification['Subject']
    [Question #...]: Installer doesn't work on a Mac
    >>> print notification_body #doctest: -NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    Question #... libstdc++ in ubuntu changed:
    http://.../ubuntu/+source/libstdc++/+question/...
    <BLANKLINE>
        Project: Ubuntu => libstdc++ in ubuntu
    <BLANKLINE>
    Summary changed to:
    Installer doesn't work on a Mac
    <BLANKLINE>
    Description changed to:
    I insert the install CD in the CD-ROM
    drive, but it won't boot.
    <BLANKLINE>
    It boots straight into MacOS 9.
    <BLANKLINE>

XXX flacoste 2006/09/19 Add checks for notification of change to
assignee, status whiteboard, priority. For example, if a question is
transfered to another QuestionTarget and priority is changed,
the notification does not include priority.

    >>> unmodified_question = Snapshot(
    ...     ubuntu_question, providing=providedBy(ubuntu_question))
    >>> ubuntu_question.target = ubuntu
    >>> notify(SQLObjectModifiedEvent(
    ...     ubuntu_question, unmodified_question, ['target']))
    >>> notifications = sorted(pop_notifications(), key=itemgetter('To'))
    >>> [notification['To'] for notification in notifications]
    ['foo.bar@canonical.com', 'support@ubuntu.com', 'test@canonical.com']

    >>> edit_notification = notifications[0]
    >>> notification_body = edit_notification.get_payload(decode=True)
    >>> print notification_body #doctest: -NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    Question #... Ubuntu changed:
    http://.../ubuntu/+question/...
    <BLANKLINE>
        Project: libstdc++ in ubuntu => Ubuntu
    <BLANKLINE>
  
If we trigger a modification event when no changes worth
notifying about was made, no notification is sent:

    >>> unmodified_question = Snapshot(
    ...     ubuntu_question, providing=providedBy(ubuntu_question))
    >>> notify(SQLObjectModifiedEvent(
    ...     ubuntu_question, unmodified_question, ['status']))

    >>> notifications = pop_notifications()
    >>> len(notifications)
    0

After receiving that notification, Foo Bar unassigned himself:

    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')
    >>> ubuntu_question.assignee = None

== Bug Linking and Unlinking Notifications ==

=== Bug link Notification ===

If we create a bug from the question, it will be reported as a
bug that has been linked to it:

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import CreateBugParams

    >>> login('no-priv@canonical.com')
    >>> unmodified_question = Snapshot(
    ...     ubuntu_question, providing=providedBy(ubuntu_question))
    >>> params = CreateBugParams(
    ...     owner=no_priv, title=ubuntu_question.title,
    ...     comment=ubuntu_question.description)
    >>> bug = ubuntu_question.target.createBug(params)
    >>> ubuntu_question.linkBug(bug)
    <QuestionBug...>
    >>> notify(SQLObjectModifiedEvent(
    ...     ubuntu_question, unmodified_question, ['bugs']))

    >>> notifications = pop_notifications()
    >>> len(notifications)
    2
    >>> edit_notification = notifications[0]
    >>> notification_body = edit_notification.get_payload(decode=True)
    >>> print notification_body #doctest: -NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    Question #... on Ubuntu changed:
    http://.../ubuntu/+question/...
    <BLANKLINE>
        Linked to bug: #...
        http://.../bugs/...
    <BLANKLINE>

=== Linked Bug Status Changed Notification ===

While a bug is linked to a question , its subscribers will be notified
of changes to the bug status:

    >>> from canonical.lp.dbschema import BugTaskStatus
    >>> bugtask = bug.bugtasks[0]
    >>> original_bugtask = Snapshot(bugtask, providing=providedBy(bugtask))
    >>> bugtask.transitionToStatus(BugTaskStatus.CONFIRMED)
    >>> bugtask.statusexplanation = 'This bug really happened to me.'
    >>> notify(SQLObjectModifiedEvent(
    ...     bugtask, original_bugtask, ['status', 'statusexplanation']))

    >>> notifications = pop_notifications()
    >>> len(notifications)
    2
    >>> [notification['To'] for notification in notifications]
    ['support@ubuntu.com', 'test@canonical.com']
    >>> notification_body = notifications[0].get_payload(decode=True)
    >>> print notifications[0]['Subject']
    [Question #...]: Status of bug #... changed to 'Confirmed' in Ubuntu
    >>> print notification_body #doctest: -NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    Bug #... status changed in Ubuntu:
    <BLANKLINE>
        Unconfirmed => Confirmed
    <BLANKLINE>
    Status change explanation given by No Privileges Person:
    <BLANKLINE>
    This bug really happened to me.
    <BLANKLINE>
    http://.../ubuntu/+bug/...
    <BLANKLINE>
    --
    You received this email because you are a subscriber of
    question #... which is linked to this bug.
    Installer doesn't work on a Mac
    http://.../ubuntu/+question/...

Only a change in status triggers a notification.

    >>> original_bugtask = Snapshot(bugtask, providing=providedBy(bugtask))
    >>> bugtask.transitionToAssignee(sample_person)
    >>> notify(SQLObjectModifiedEvent(
    ...     bugtask, original_bugtask, ['assignee', 'dateassigned']))

    >>> len(pop_notifications())
    0

=== Bug Unlinked Notification ===

A notification is also sent when a bug is unlinked from the question:

    >>> unmodified_question = Snapshot(ubuntu_question,
    ...     providing=providedBy(ubuntu_question))
    >>> ubuntu_question.unlinkBug(bug)
    <QuestionBug...>
    >>> notify(SQLObjectModifiedEvent(
    ...     ubuntu_question, unmodified_question, ['bugs']))

    >>> notifications = pop_notifications()
    >>> len(notifications)
    2

    >>> edit_notification = notifications[0]
    >>> notification_body = edit_notification.get_payload(decode=True)
    >>> print notification_body #doctest: -NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    Question #... on Ubuntu changed:
    http://.../ubuntu/+question/...
    <BLANKLINE>
        Removed link to bug: #13
        http://.../bugs/13
    <BLANKLINE>

== Workflow Notifications ==

Notifications are also sent when workflow actions are done on questions.
The content of the notification will be different depending on the
workflow action done.

    >>> request_message = ubuntu_question.requestInfo(
    ...     no_priv, "What is your Mac model?")

    >>> notifications = pop_notifications()
    >>> [email_msg['To'] for email_msg in notifications]
    ['support@ubuntu.com', 'test@canonical.com']
    >>> support_notification = notifications[0]
    >>> support_notification['Subject']
    "Re: [Question #...]: Installer doesn't work on a Mac"

For workflow notifications, the content of the notification is slightly
different based on whether you are the question owner or somebody else.

For example, the notification to the answer contacts and every other
subscribers except the question owner will look like this:

    >>> notification_body = support_notification.get_payload(decode=True)
    >>> print notification_body #doctest: -NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    Question #... on Ubuntu changed:
    http://.../ubuntu/+question/...
    <BLANKLINE>
        Status: Open => Needs information
    <BLANKLINE>
    No Privileges Person requested for more information:
    What is your Mac model?
    <BLANKLINE>

But the owner notification has a slightly different preamble and has
an extra footer.

    >>> notification_body = notifications[1].get_payload(decode=True)
    >>> print notification_body #doctest: -NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    Your question #... on Ubuntu changed:
    http://.../ubuntu/+question/...
    <BLANKLINE>
        Status: Open => Needs information
    <BLANKLINE>
    No Privileges Person requested for more information:
    What is your Mac model?
    <BLANKLINE>
    _______________________________________________________________________
    To answer this request for more information, you can either reply to
    this email or enter your reply at the following page:
    http://.../ubuntu/+question/...
    <BLANKLINE>

Of course, if the owner unsubscribe from the question, he won't receives
a notification.

    >>> login('test@canonical.com')
    >>> ubuntu_question.unsubscribe(sample_person)
    >>> message = ubuntu_question.giveInfo('A PowerMac 7200.')

    >>> notifications = pop_notifications()
    >>> [email_msg['To'] for email_msg in notifications]
    ['support@ubuntu.com']

    >>> notification_body = notifications[0].get_payload(decode=True)
    >>> print notification_body #doctest: -NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    Question #... on Ubuntu changed:
    http://.../ubuntu/+question/...
    <BLANKLINE>
        Status: Needs information => Open
    <BLANKLINE>
    Sample Person gave more information on the question:
    A PowerMac 7200.
    <BLANKLINE>

The notification for new messages on the question contain a 'References'
header to the previous message for threading purpose.

    >>> print notifications[0]['References']
    <...>
    >>> notifications[0]['References'] == ubuntu_question.messages[-2].rfc822msgid
    True

We already saw the notifications sent for the requestInfo() and
giveInfo() transitions, let's see the other ones.

    # Subscribe the owner back, to compare the different notifications
    # sent.
    >>> ubuntu_question.subscribe(sample_person)
    <QuestionSubscription ...>

=== Notifications for expireQuestion() ===

    >>> login('no-priv@canonical.com')
    >>> message = ubuntu_question.expireQuestion(
    ...     no_priv, "Expired because of no recent activity.")

    >>> notifications = pop_notifications()
    >>> [email_msg['To'] for email_msg in notifications]
    ['support@ubuntu.com', 'test@canonical.com']

Default notification when the question is expired:

    >>> notification_body = notifications[0].get_payload(decode=True)
    >>> print notification_body #doctest: -NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    Question #... on Ubuntu changed:
    http://.../ubuntu/+question/...
    <BLANKLINE>
        Status: Open => Expired
    <BLANKLINE>
    No Privileges Person expired the question:
    Expired because of no recent activity.
    <BLANKLINE>

Notification received by the owner:

    >>> notification_body = notifications[1].get_payload(decode=True)
    >>> print notification_body #doctest: -NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    Your question #... on Ubuntu changed:
    http://.../ubuntu/+question/...
    <BLANKLINE>
        Status: Open => Expired
    <BLANKLINE>
    No Privileges Person expired the question:
    Expired because of no recent activity.
    <BLANKLINE>
    _______________________________________________________________________
    If you're still having this problem, you can reopen your question either
    by replying to this email or by going to the following page and
    entering more information about your problem:
    http://.../ubuntu/+question/...
    <BLANKLINE>

=== Notifications for reopen() ===

(This example will also show that comments are wrapped for 72 columns
display.)

    >>> login('test@canonical.com')
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IMessageSet
    >>> email_msg = getUtility(IMessageSet).fromText(
    ...     subject=(
    ...         "Re: [Question %d]: Installer doesn't work on "
    ...         "a Mac" % ubuntu_question.id),
    ...     content=(
    ...         "I really need some help. I tried googling a bit but didn't "
    ...         "find anything useful.\n\nPlease provide some help to a "
    ...         "newbie."),
    ...     owner=sample_person)
    >>> message = ubuntu_question.reopen(email_msg)

    >>> notifications = pop_notifications()
    >>> [email_msg['To'] for email_msg in notifications]
    ['support@ubuntu.com', 'test@canonical.com']

Notice also how the 'Re' handling is handled nicely:

    >>> print notifications[0]['Subject']
    Re: [Question #...]: Installer doesn't work on a Mac

Default notification when the owner reopens the question:

    >>> notification_body = notifications[0].get_payload(decode=True)

== Notifications and Teams ==

When a team is subscribed to a question, there are two cases two consider.
The first one is if the team has an email address set, a notification
will only be sent to that address. (That email address is assumed to
be a mailing list reaching all the team members.) We already saw an
example of that case with the Ubuntu Team in the examples above.

The other case is when the team doesn't have an email address set. In
that case, all the team members will be notified individually.

    >>> launchpad_devs = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('launchpad')
    >>> ubuntu_question.subscribe(launchpad_devs)
    <QuestionSubscription...>

    >>> login('test@canonical.com')
    >>> message = ubuntu_question.addComment(sample_person, 'A comment.')

    >>> notifications = pop_notifications()
    >>> [email_msg['To'] for email_msg in notifications]
    ['foo.bar@canonical.com', 'support@ubuntu.com', 'test@canonical.com']

Of course, if the user is also individually subscribed to the question, he
will receives only one notification:

    >>> ubuntu_question.subscribe(foo_bar)
    <QuestionSubscription...>

    >>> message = ubuntu_question.addComment(sample_person, 'A comment.')

    >>> notifications = pop_notifications()
    >>> [email_msg['To'] for email_msg in notifications]
    ['foo.bar@canonical.com', 'support@ubuntu.com', 'test@canonical.com']

== Notifications and Localized Questions ==

In general, only subscribers speaking the language of the question will
receive notifications related to it.

    # Register salgado as answer contact, this makes the pt_BR language
    # supported in Ubuntu.
    >>> salgado = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('salgado')
    >>> ubuntu.addAnswerContact(salgado)
    True
    >>> sorted([lang.code for lang in ubuntu.getSupportedLanguages()])
    [u'en', u'pt_BR']

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import ILanguageSet
    >>> login('test@canonical.com')
    >>> pt_BR_question = ubuntu.newQuestion(
    ...     sample_person, title=(
    ...     u"Abrir uma p\xe1gina que requer java quebra o firefox"),
    ...     description=(
    ...         u'Eu uso Ubuntu em um AMD64 e instalei o plugin java '
    ...         u'blackdown. O plugin \xe9 exibido em about:plugins e '
    ...         u'quando eu abro a pagina '
    ...         u'http://java.com/en/download/help/testvm.xml, ela carrega '
    ...         u'corretamente e mostra a minha versao do java. No entanto, '
    ...         u'mover o mouse na pagina faz com que o firefox quebre.'),
    ...     language=getUtility(ILanguageSet)['pt_BR'])
    >>> notify(SQLObjectCreatedEvent(pt_BR_question))
    >>> notifications = pop_notifications()
    >>> [email_msg['To'] for email_msg in notifications]
    ['guilherme.salgado@canonical.com', 'test@canonical.com']

    >>> from email.Header import decode_header, make_header
    >>> unicode(make_header(decode_header(notifications[0]['Subject'])))
    u'[Question #...]: Abrir uma p\xe1gina que requer java quebra o firefox'

Similarly, when a question in a non-English language is modified or its
status changed, only the subscribers speaking that language will receive
the notifications.

    >>> pt_BR_question.giveInfo("Veja o screenshot: http://tinyurl.com/y8jq8z")
    <QuestionMessage...>
    >>> notifications = pop_notifications()
    >>> [email_msg['To'] for email_msg in notifications]
    ['guilherme.salgado@canonical.com', 'test@canonical.com']

The exception to these general rules is that when a question is created
in language spoken by none of the answer contacts, each one will receive
an email notifying them that a question was posted in an unsupported
language.

For example, the French language is not spoken by any Ubuntu answer
contacts. So after posting a question in French, a notification will be
sent to the support list about that question:

    >>> french = getUtility(ILanguageSet)['fr']
    >>> french_question = ubuntu.newQuestion(
    ...     sample_person, title="Impossible d'installer Ubuntu",
    ...     description=u"Le CD ne semble pas fonctionn\xe9.",
    ...     language=french)
    >>> notify(SQLObjectCreatedEvent(french_question))
    >>> notifications = pop_notifications()
    >>> [email_msg['To'] for email_msg in notifications]
    ['guilherme.salgado@canonical.com', 'support@ubuntu.com',
     'test@canonical.com']

    >>> notifications[0]['Subject']
    "[Question #...]: (French) Impossible d'installer Ubuntu"

    >>> notification_body = notifications[0].get_payload(decode=True)
    >>> print notification_body #doctest: -NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    A question was asked in a language (French) spoken by
    none of the registered Ubuntu answer contacts.
    <BLANKLINE>

The notification received by the question owner contain a warning that
the question is in a language spoken by none of the answer contacts:

    >>> notifications[-1]['Subject']

    # Define a function that will replace non-ascii character with

    # Effectively replace u'\xe9' by '\\e9'.
    >>> import re
    >>> def escape_utf8_payload(message):
    ...     charset = message.get_content_charset()
    ...     content = unicode(message.get_payload(decode=True), charset)
    ...     return content.encode('us-ascii', 'backslashreplace')

=== Localized Questions and Teams ===

There are some tricky issues when sending notifications to teams about a
question. There are some cases to consider.

First, when the team has an explicit email address (which will be a
mailing list usually), we will notify the team only if the question
language is in one of the team spoken languages. The team spoken
languages is either the list of languages associated to the team or
the list of the languages spoken by the team members.

For example, the rosetta admins team doesn't have any languages
configured. But among its members, Carlos speaks Spanish. So, the team
will be notified if a Spanish question is created.

    >>> rosetta_admins = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('rosetta-admins')
    >>> [lang.code for lang in rosetta_admins.languages]
    []
    >>> carlos = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('carlos')
    >>> carlos.inTeam(rosetta_admins)
    True
    >>> spanish = getUtility(ILanguageSet)['es']
    >>> spanish in carlos.languages
    True

    >>> ubuntu.addAnswerContact(rosetta_admins)
    True
    >>> spanish_question = ubuntu.newQuestion(
    ...     sample_person, title="Necesidad ayuda con Firefox",
    ...     description="No puedo acceso al Internet en Firefox.",
    ...     language=spanish)
    >>> notify(SQLObjectCreatedEvent(spanish_question))
    >>> notifications = pop_notifications()
    >>> [email_msg['To'] for email_msg in notifications]
    ['rosetta@launchpad.net', 'test@canonical.com']

But if the team languages attribute is set, this set of languages will
be used. So, if the team only officially speaks French, it will only
receives notifications about French (and English) questions.

    >>> rosetta_admins.addLanguage(french)
    >>> notify(SQLObjectCreatedEvent(french_question))
    >>> notifications = pop_notifications()
    >>> [email_msg['To'] for email_msg in notifications]
    ['rosetta@launchpad.net', 'test@canonical.com']

The second case to consider is when the team doesn't use an explicit
address. When the team has configured its supported languages, all
team members will be contacted if the question language is supported.
For example, the Launchpad Developers team doesn't have any preferred
email address set. Its only member, Foo Bar will receive a notification
if the team supported languages includes the question language:

    >>> launchpad_devs = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('launchpad')
    >>> list(launchpad_devs.languages)
    []
    >>> [member.name for member in launchpad_devs.activemembers]
    [u'name16']
    >>> launchpad_devs.addLanguage(spanish)
    >>> ubuntu.addAnswerContact(launchpad_devs)
    True

    >>> notify(SQLObjectCreatedEvent(spanish_question))
    >>> notifications = pop_notifications()
    >>> [email_msg['To'] for email_msg in notifications]
    ['foo.bar@canonical.com', 'test@canonical.com']

Teams my choose to restrict the notifications they receive to a few
limited languages (in conjunction with setting their preferred 
languages). Teams will not be notified of English questions if English
is not one of their their supported languages. For example, when
rosetta_admins remove English from their preferred languages, French
becomes the only language they will receive email for.

    >>> english = getUtility(ILanguageSet)['en']
    >>> rosetta_admins.removeLanguage(english)
    >>> ubuntu.addAnswerContact(rosetta_admins, limited_languages=True)
    True
  
    >>> from canonical.database.sqlbase import flush_database_updates
    >>> flush_database_updates()
    >>> contacts = ubuntu.getAnswerContactsForLanguage(french)
    >>> [contact.name for contact in contacts]
    [u'salgado', u'launchpad', u'rosetta-admins', u'ubuntu-team']
    
    >>> contacts = ubuntu.getAnswerContactsForLanguage(english)
    >>> [contact.name for contact in contacts]
    [u'salgado', u'launchpad', u'ubuntu-team']
    
    >>> english_question = ubuntu.newQuestion(
    ...     sample_person, "Can't install Ubuntu",
    ...    "I insert the install CD in the CD-ROM drive, but it won't boot.",
    ...     language=english)
    >>> notify(SQLObjectCreatedEvent(english_question))
    >>> notifications = pop_notifications()
    >>> addresses = [email_msg['To'] for email_msg in notifications]
    >>> 'rosetta@launchpad.net' in addresses
    False
    
The limited languages condition is also true for teams without
a contact email address. From above, Foo Bar is the only member of 
launchpad_devs, and the team's preferred languages only contains
Spanish.

    >>> ubuntu.addAnswerContact(launchpad_devs, limited_languages=True)
    True

    >>> flush_database_updates()
    >>> notify(SQLObjectCreatedEvent(english_question))
    >>> notifications = pop_notifications()
    >>> addresses = [email_msg['To'] for email_msg in notifications]
    >>> 'foo.bar@canonical.com' in addresses
    False

But when the team didn't configured its supported language set, only the
team members that speaks the language of the question will be notified.
For example, Carlos is a member of the admins team which doesn't have
a preferred address. So, he'll be the only member of the admin team
to be notified when a question in Spanish is posted.

    >>> admins = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('admins')
    >>> list(admins.languages)
    []
    >>> carlos.inTeam(admins)
    True
    >>> ubuntu.addAnswerContact(admins)
    True

    >>> notify(SQLObjectCreatedEvent(spanish_question))
    >>> notifications = pop_notifications()
    >>> [email_msg['To'] for email_msg in notifications]
    ['carlos@canonical.com', 'foo.bar@canonical.com',
     'test@canonical.com']

When a team is a member of a team with no email address, these rules
are applied recursively. So, if we make GuadaMen team a member of the
admin team, its notification will be computed according to that
team settings. That is a notification will be sent to its preferred
address if Spanish is among its preferred languages:

    >>> guadamen = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('guadamen')
    >>> list(guadamen.languages)
    []
    >>> foobar = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('name16')

    # This call also generates email notifications, so we'll clean up
    # stub.test_emails after it
    >>> admins.addMember(guadamen, reviewer=foobar)
    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.mail import stub
    >>> stub.test_emails = []

    >>> guadamen.addLanguage(spanish)

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IEmailAddressSet
    >>> guadamen_email = getUtility(IEmailAddressSet).new(
    ...     'maintainers@guadalinex.com', guadamen)
    >>> guadamen.validateAndEnsurePreferredEmail(guadamen_email)

    >>> notify(SQLObjectCreatedEvent(spanish_question))
    >>> notifications = pop_notifications()
    >>> [email_msg['To'] for email_msg in notifications]
    ['carlos@canonical.com', 'foo.bar@canonical.com',
     'maintainers@guadalinex.com', 'test@canonical.com']
