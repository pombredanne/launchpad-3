= Answer Tracker Email Notifications =

When a question is created or changed, an email notification is sent out,
informing the subscribers and the answer contacts about the change.
Let's start with creating a question, and see what the resulting
notification looks like:

    >>> from zope.event import notify
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.event import SQLObjectCreatedEvent
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IDistributionSet
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.tests.mail_helpers import pop_notifications
    >>> login('test@canonical.com')
    >>> sample_person = getUtility(ILaunchBag).user
    >>> ubuntu = getUtility(IDistributionSet).getByName('ubuntu')
    >>> ubuntu_question = ubuntu.newQuestion(
    ...     sample_person, "Can't install Ubuntu",
    ...    "I insert the install CD in the CD-ROM drive, but it won't boot.")

The notifications get sent to the question's subscribers, the question's
target answer contacts as well as to the question's assignee. Initially,
only the submitter, Sample Person, is subscribed to the question and there
is no answer contact registered on Ubuntu, so only 1 notification is
sent:

    >>> ubuntu.answer_contacts
    []
    >>> [sub.person.displayname for sub in ubuntu_question.subscriptions]
    [u'Sample Person']
    >>> notifications = pop_notifications()
    >>> len(notifications)
    1

    >>> add_notification = notifications[0]
    >>> add_notification['From']
    'Sample Person <question...@answers.launchpad.net>'
    >>> add_notification['To']
    'test@canonical.com'
    >>> add_notification['Subject']
    "[Question #...]: Can't install Ubuntu"

Like all Launchpad notifications should, the message contain in the
footer the reason why the user is receiving the notification.

    >>> notification_body = add_notification.get_payload(decode=True)
    >>> print notification_body #doctest: -NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    New question #... on Ubuntu:
    http://.../ubuntu/+question/...
    <BLANKLINE>
    I insert the install CD in the CD-ROM drive, but it won't boot.
    <BLANKLINE>
    --...
    You received this question notification because you are a direct
    subscriber of the question.

The notification also includes a 'X-Launchpad-Question' header that
contains information about the question.

    >>> print add_notification['X-Launchpad-Question']
    distribution=ubuntu; sourcepackage=None; status=Open;
    assignee=None; priority=Normal; language=en

As well as the standard 'X-Launchpad-Message-Rationale' header that
contains in short format the reason for the user to be contacted.

    >>> print add_notification['X-Launchpad-Message-Rationale']
    Subscriber

Register the Ubuntu Team as Ubuntu's answer contact, so that they get
notified about the changes as well:

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import ILanguageSet, IPersonSet
    >>> ubuntu_team = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('ubuntu-team')
    >>> ubuntu_team.addLanguage(getUtility(ILanguageSet)['en'])
    >>> ubuntu.addAnswerContact(ubuntu_team)
    True

And assign this question to Foo Bar, so that he will also receive
notifications:

    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')
    >>> ubuntu_question.assignee = getUtility(ILaunchBag).user

== Edit Notifications ==

If we edit the title and description of the question, a notification
will be sent.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.event import SQLObjectModifiedEvent
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.webapp.snapshot import Snapshot
    >>> from zope.interface import providedBy

    >>> login('no-priv@canonical.com')
    >>> no_priv = getUtility(ILaunchBag).user
    >>> unmodified_question = Snapshot(
    ...     ubuntu_question, providing=providedBy(ubuntu_question))
    >>> ubuntu_question.title = "Installer doesn't work on a Mac"
    >>> ubuntu_question.description = """I insert the install CD in the CD-ROM
    ... drive, but it won't boot.
    ...
    ... It boots straight into MacOS 9."""
    >>> libstdcplusplus_sourcepackage = ubuntu.getSourcePackage('libstdc++')
    >>> ubuntu_question.target = libstdcplusplus_sourcepackage
    >>> notify(SQLObjectModifiedEvent(
    ...     ubuntu_question, unmodified_question,
    ...     ['title', 'description', 'target']))

Three copies of the notification got sent, one to Sample Person, one to
Foo Bar, and one to Ubuntu Team:

    >>> from operator import itemgetter
    >>> notifications = sorted(pop_notifications(), key=itemgetter('To'))
    >>> [notification['To'] for notification in notifications]
    ['foo.bar@canonical.com', 'support@ubuntu.com', 'test@canonical.com']

    >>> edit_notification = notifications[0]
    >>> notification_body = edit_notification.get_payload(decode=True)
    >>> print edit_notification['Subject']
    [Question #...]: Installer doesn't work on a Mac
    >>> print notification_body #doctest: -NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    Question #... libstdc++ in ubuntu changed:
    http://.../ubuntu/+source/libstdc++/+question/...
    <BLANKLINE>
        Project: Ubuntu => libstdc++ in ubuntu
    <BLANKLINE>
    Summary changed to:
    Installer doesn't work on a Mac
    <BLANKLINE>
    Description changed to:
    I insert the install CD in the CD-ROM
    drive, but it won't boot.
    <BLANKLINE>
    It boots straight into MacOS 9.
    <BLANKLINE>
    --...
    You received this question notification because you are the assignee for
    this question.

# XXX flacoste 2006-09-19: Add checks for notification of change to
# assignee, status whiteboard, priority. For example, if a question is
# transferred to another QuestionTarget and priority is changed,
# the notification does not include priority.

    >>> unmodified_question = Snapshot(
    ...     ubuntu_question, providing=providedBy(ubuntu_question))
    >>> ubuntu_question.target = ubuntu
    >>> notify(SQLObjectModifiedEvent(
    ...     ubuntu_question, unmodified_question, ['target']))
    >>> notifications = sorted(pop_notifications(), key=itemgetter('To'))
    >>> [notification['To'] for notification in notifications]
    ['foo.bar@canonical.com', 'support@ubuntu.com', 'test@canonical.com']

    >>> edit_notification = notifications[0]
    >>> notification_body = edit_notification.get_payload(decode=True)
    >>> print notification_body #doctest: -NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    Question #... Ubuntu changed:
    http://.../ubuntu/+question/...
    <BLANKLINE>
        Project: libstdc++ in ubuntu => Ubuntu
    <BLANKLINE>
    --...
    You received this question notification because you are the assignee for
    this question.

If we trigger a modification event when no changes worth
notifying about was made, no notification is sent:

    >>> unmodified_question = Snapshot(
    ...     ubuntu_question, providing=providedBy(ubuntu_question))
    >>> notify(SQLObjectModifiedEvent(
    ...     ubuntu_question, unmodified_question, ['status']))

    >>> notifications = pop_notifications()
    >>> len(notifications)
    0

After receiving that notification, Foo Bar unassigned himself:

    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')
    >>> ubuntu_question.assignee = None

== Bug Linking and Unlinking Notifications ==

=== Bug link Notification ===

If we create a bug from the question, it will be reported as a
bug that has been linked to it:

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import CreateBugParams

    >>> login('no-priv@canonical.com')
    >>> unmodified_question = Snapshot(
    ...     ubuntu_question, providing=providedBy(ubuntu_question))
    >>> params = CreateBugParams(
    ...     owner=no_priv, title="Installer fails on a Mac PPC",
    ...     comment=ubuntu_question.description)
    >>> bug = ubuntu_question.target.createBug(params)
    >>> ubuntu_question.linkBug(bug)
    <QuestionBug...>
    >>> notify(SQLObjectModifiedEvent(
    ...     ubuntu_question, unmodified_question, ['bugs']))

    >>> notifications = pop_notifications()
    >>> len(notifications)
    2
    >>> edit_notification = notifications[0]
    >>> notification_body = edit_notification.get_payload(decode=True)
    >>> print notification_body #doctest: -NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    Question #... on Ubuntu changed:
    http://.../ubuntu/+question/...
    <BLANKLINE>
        Linked to bug: #...
        http://.../bugs/...
        "Installer fails on a Mac PPC"
    <BLANKLINE>
    --...
    You received this question notification because you are a member of
    Ubuntu Team, which is an answer contact for Ubuntu.

=== Bug Unlinked Notification ===

A notification is also sent when a bug is unlinked from the question:

    >>> unmodified_question = Snapshot(ubuntu_question,
    ...     providing=providedBy(ubuntu_question))
    >>> ubuntu_question.unlinkBug(bug)
    <QuestionBug...>
    >>> notify(SQLObjectModifiedEvent(
    ...     ubuntu_question, unmodified_question, ['bugs']))

    >>> notifications = pop_notifications()
    >>> len(notifications)
    2

    >>> edit_notification = notifications[0]
    >>> notification_body = edit_notification.get_payload(decode=True)
    >>> print notification_body #doctest: -NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    Question #... on Ubuntu changed:
    http://.../ubuntu/+question/...
    <BLANKLINE>
        Removed link to bug: #...
        http://.../bugs/...
        "Installer fails on a Mac PPC"
    <BLANKLINE>
    --...
    You received this question notification because you are a member of
    Ubuntu Team, which is an answer contact for Ubuntu.


=== Linked Bug Status Changed Notification ===

When a question is linked to a bug, the question's subscribers are
notified of changes of the bug status. See
answer-tracker-notifications-linked-bug.txt for more information.


== Workflow Notifications ==

Notifications are also sent when workflow actions are done on questions.
The content of the notification will be different depending on the
workflow action done.

    >>> request_message = ubuntu_question.requestInfo(
    ...     no_priv, "What is your Mac model?")

    >>> notifications = pop_notifications()
    >>> [email_msg['To'] for email_msg in notifications]
    ['support@ubuntu.com', 'test@canonical.com']
    >>> support_notification = notifications[0]
    >>> support_notification['Subject']
    "Re: [Question #...]: Installer doesn't work on a Mac"

For workflow notifications, the content of the notification is slightly
different based on whether you are the question owner or somebody else.

For example, the notification to the answer contacts and every other
subscribers except the question owner will look like this:

    >>> notification_body = support_notification.get_payload(decode=True)
    >>> print notification_body #doctest: -NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    Question #... on Ubuntu changed:
    http://.../ubuntu/+question/...
    <BLANKLINE>
        Status: Open => Needs information
    <BLANKLINE>
    No Privileges Person requested for more information:
    What is your Mac model?
    <BLANKLINE>
    --...
    You received this question notification because you are a member of
    Ubuntu Team, which is an answer contact for Ubuntu.

But the owner notification has a slightly different preamble and has
an extra footer.

    >>> notification_body = notifications[1].get_payload(decode=True)
    >>> print notification_body #doctest: -NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    Your question #... on Ubuntu changed:
    http://.../ubuntu/+question/...
    <BLANKLINE>
        Status: Open => Needs information
    <BLANKLINE>
    No Privileges Person requested for more information:
    What is your Mac model?
    <BLANKLINE>
    --...
    To answer this request for more information, you can either reply to
    this email or enter your reply at the following page:
    http://.../ubuntu/+question/...
    <BLANKLINE>
    You received this question notification because you are a direct
    subscriber of the question.

Of course, if the owner unsubscribe from the question, he won't receives
a notification.

    >>> login('test@canonical.com')
    >>> ubuntu_question.unsubscribe(sample_person)
    >>> message = ubuntu_question.giveInfo('A PowerMac 7200.')

    >>> notifications = pop_notifications()
    >>> [email_msg['To'] for email_msg in notifications]
    ['support@ubuntu.com']

    >>> notification_body = notifications[0].get_payload(decode=True)
    >>> print notification_body #doctest: -NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    Question #... on Ubuntu changed:
    http://.../ubuntu/+question/...
    <BLANKLINE>
        Status: Needs information => Open
    <BLANKLINE>

    A PowerMac 7200.
    <BLANKLINE>
    --...
    You received this question notification because you are a member of
    Ubuntu Team, which is an answer contact for Ubuntu.

The notification for new messages on the question contain a 'References'
header to the previous message for threading purpose.

    >>> print notifications[0]['References']
    <...>
    >>> notifications[0]['References'] == ubuntu_question.messages[-2].rfc822msgid
    True

We already saw the notifications sent for the requestInfo() and
giveInfo() transitions, let's see the other ones.

    # Subscribe the owner back, to compare the different notifications
    # sent.
    >>> ubuntu_question.subscribe(sample_person)
    <QuestionSubscription ...>

=== Notifications for expireQuestion() ===

    >>> login('no-priv@canonical.com')
    >>> message = ubuntu_question.expireQuestion(
    ...     no_priv, "Expired because of no recent activity.")

    >>> notifications = pop_notifications()
    >>> [email_msg['To'] for email_msg in notifications]
    ['support@ubuntu.com', 'test@canonical.com']

Default notification when the question is expired:

    >>> notification_body = notifications[0].get_payload(decode=True)

=== Notifications for reopen() ===

(This example will also show that comments are wrapped for 72 columns
display.)

    >>> login('test@canonical.com')
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IMessageSet
    >>> email_msg = getUtility(IMessageSet).fromText(
    ...     subject=(
    ...         "Re: [Question %d]: Installer doesn't work on "
    ...         "a Mac" % ubuntu_question.id),

    >>> notifications = pop_notifications()
    >>> [email_msg['To'] for email_msg in notifications]
    ['support@ubuntu.com', 'test@canonical.com']

Notice also how the 'Re' handling is handled nicely:

    >>> print notifications[0]['Subject']
    Re: [Question #...]: Installer doesn't work on a Mac

=== Notifications for linkFAQ() ===

When a user links a FAQ to a question, the notification includes that
information before the message.

    >>> login('no-priv@canonical.com')
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IProductSet
    >>> firefox = getUtility(IProductSet).getByName('firefox')
    >>> firefox_question = firefox.newQuestion(
    ...     no_priv, 'How can I play Flash?', 'I want Flash!')

    # Discard notifications.
    >>> notifications = pop_notifications()

    >>> login('test@canonical.com')
    >>> firefox_faq = firefox.getFAQ(10)
    >>> print firefox_faq.title
    How do I install plugins (Shockwave, QuickTime, etc.)?
    >>> message = firefox_question.linkFAQ(
    ...     sample_person, firefox_faq, "Read the FAQ.")

    >>> notifications = pop_notifications()
    >>> [email_msg['To'] for email_msg in notifications]
    ['no-priv@canonical.com']

    >>> notification_body = notifications[0].get_payload(decode=True)

== Notifications and Teams ==

When a team is subscribed to a question, there are two cases two consider.
The first one is if the team has an email address set, a notification
will only be sent to that address. (That email address is assumed to
be a mailing list reaching all the team members.) We already saw an
example of that case with the Ubuntu Team in the examples above.

The other case is when the team doesn't have an email address set. In
that case, all the team members will be notified individually.

    >>> launchpad_devs = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('launchpad')
    >>> ubuntu_question.subscribe(launchpad_devs)
    <QuestionSubscription...>

    >>> login('test@canonical.com')
    >>> message = ubuntu_question.addComment(sample_person, 'A comment.')

    >>> notifications = pop_notifications()
    >>> [email_msg['To'] for email_msg in notifications]
    ['foo.bar@canonical.com', 'support@ubuntu.com', 'test@canonical.com']

Of course, if the user is also individually subscribed to the question, he
will receives only one notification:

    >>> ubuntu_question.subscribe(foo_bar)
    <QuestionSubscription...>

    >>> message = ubuntu_question.addComment(sample_person, 'A comment.')

    >>> notifications = pop_notifications()
    >>> [email_msg['To'] for email_msg in notifications]
    ['foo.bar@canonical.com', 'support@ubuntu.com', 'test@canonical.com']


== Notifications and Localized Questions ==

In general, only subscribers speaking the language of the question will
receive notifications related to it.

    # Register salgado as answer contact, this makes the pt_BR language
    # supported in Ubuntu.
    >>> salgado = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('salgado')
    >>> ubuntu.addAnswerContact(salgado)
    True
    >>> sorted([lang.code for lang in ubuntu.getSupportedLanguages()])
    [u'en', u'pt_BR']

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import ILanguageSet
    >>> login('test@canonical.com')
    >>> pt_BR_question = ubuntu.newQuestion(
    ...     sample_person, title=(
    ...     u"Abrir uma p\xe1gina que requer java quebra o firefox"),
    ...     description=(
    ...         u'Eu uso Ubuntu em um AMD64 e instalei o plugin java '
    ...         u'blackdown. O plugin \xe9 exibido em about:plugins e '
    ...         u'quando eu abro a pagina '
    ...         u'http://java.com/en/download/help/testvm.xml, ela carrega '
    ...         u'corretamente e mostra a minha versao do java. No entanto, '
    ...         u'mover o mouse na pagina faz com que o firefox quebre.'),
    ...     language=getUtility(ILanguageSet)['pt_BR'])
    >>> notifications = pop_notifications()
    >>> [email_msg['To'] for email_msg in notifications]
    ['guilherme.salgado@canonical.com', 'test@canonical.com']

    >>> from email.Header import decode_header, make_header
    >>> unicode(make_header(decode_header(notifications[0]['Subject'])))
    u'[Question #...]: Abrir uma p\xe1gina que requer java quebra o firefox'

Similarly, when a question in a non-English language is modified or its
status changed, only the subscribers speaking that language will receive
the notifications.

    >>> pt_BR_question.giveInfo("Veja o screenshot: http://tinyurl.com/y8jq8z")
    <QuestionMessage...>
    >>> notifications = pop_notifications()
    >>> [email_msg['To'] for email_msg in notifications]
    ['guilherme.salgado@canonical.com', 'test@canonical.com']

The exception to these general rules is that when a question is created
in language spoken by none of the answer contacts, each one will receive
an email notifying them that a question was posted in an unsupported
language.

For example, the French language is not spoken by any Ubuntu answer
contacts. So after posting a question in French, a notification will be
sent to the support list about that question:

    >>> french = getUtility(ILanguageSet)['fr']
    >>> french_question = ubuntu.newQuestion(
    ...     sample_person, title="Impossible d'installer Ubuntu",
    ...     description=u"Le CD ne semble pas fonctionn\xe9.",
    ...     language=french)
    >>> notifications = pop_notifications()
    >>> [email_msg['To'] for email_msg in notifications]
    ['guilherme.salgado@canonical.com', 'support@ubuntu.com',
     'test@canonical.com']

    >>> notifications[0]['Subject']
    "[Question #...]: (French) Impossible d'installer Ubuntu"

    # Define a function that will replace non-ascii character with
    # its unicoded encoded value.
    # Effectively replace u'\xe9' by '\\e9'.
    >>> import re
    >>> def escape_utf8_payload(message):
    ...     charset = message.get_content_charset()
    ...     content = unicode(message.get_payload(decode=True), charset)
    ...     return content.encode('us-ascii', 'backslashreplace')

    >>> notification_body = escape_utf8_payload(notifications[0])
    >>> print notification_body #doctest: -NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    A question was asked in a language (French) spoken by
    none of the registered Ubuntu answer contacts.

    You received this question notification because you are a direct
    subscriber of the question.

No notification will be sent to the answer contacts when this question
is modified. Only the owner will receive a modification notification
with a warning appended to it.

    >>> unmodified_question = Snapshot(
    ...     french_question, providing=providedBy(french_question))
    >>> french_question.title = u"CD d'Ubuntu ne d\xe9marre pas"
    >>> notify(SQLObjectModifiedEvent(
    ...     french_question, unmodified_question, ['title']))

    >>> notifications = pop_notifications()
    >>> [email_msg['To'] for email_msg in notifications]
    ['test@canonical.com']

    subscriber of the question.

=== Localized Questions and Teams ===

We will notify the team only if the question language is in one of
the team's preferred languages. The languages spoken by the team
members is unimportant.

For example, the rosetta admins team becomes an Answer contact for
English questions. Carlos speaks Spanish, and he is an answer contact
for Ubuntu. He is also a member of the rosetta admins team. The team
wont receive emails because of his membership when they become answer
contacts too.

    >>> rosetta_admins = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('rosetta-admins')
    >>> [lang.code for lang in rosetta_admins.languages]
    []
    >>> rosetta_admins.addLanguage(getUtility(ILanguageSet)['en'])
    >>> carlos = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('carlos')
    >>> carlos.inTeam(rosetta_admins)
    True
    >>> spanish = getUtility(ILanguageSet)['es']
    >>> spanish in carlos.languages
    True

    >>> ubuntu.addAnswerContact(carlos)
    True
    >>> ubuntu.addAnswerContact(rosetta_admins)
    True
    >>> spanish_question = ubuntu.newQuestion(
    ...     sample_person, title="Necesidad ayuda con Firefox",
    ...     description="No puedo acceso al Internet en Firefox.",
    ...     language=spanish)
    >>> notifications = pop_notifications()
    >>> [email_msg['To'] for email_msg in notifications]
    ['carlos@canonical.com', 'test@canonical.com']

    >>> ubuntu.removeAnswerContact(carlos)
    True

But if the team languages attribute is set, this set of languages will
be used. So, if the team only officially speaks French, it will only
receive notifications about French (and English) questions.

    >>> rosetta_admins.addLanguage(french)
    >>> # Resend the new message notification
    >>> notify(SQLObjectCreatedEvent(french_question))
    >>> notifications = pop_notifications()
    >>> [email_msg['To'] for email_msg in notifications]
    ['rosetta@launchpad.net', 'test@canonical.com']

When the team doesn't use an explicit address. All
team members will be contacted if the question language is supported.
For example, the Launchpad Developers team doesn't have any preferred
email address set. Its only member, Foo Bar will receive a notification
if the team supported languages includes the question language:

    >>> launchpad_devs = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('launchpad')
    >>> list(launchpad_devs.languages)
    []
    >>> [member.name for member in launchpad_devs.activemembers]
    [u'name16']
    >>> launchpad_devs.addLanguage(spanish)
    >>> ubuntu.addAnswerContact(launchpad_devs)
    True

    >>> # Resend the new message notification
    >>> notify(SQLObjectCreatedEvent(spanish_question))
    >>> notifications = pop_notifications()
    >>> [email_msg['To'] for email_msg in notifications]
    ['foo.bar@canonical.com', 'test@canonical.com']


== Preventing new question notification ==

New question notifications can disabled when the application needs
to create a question outside the standard workflow. The do_notify
keyword arg is True by default. Setting it to False will prevent
the new question from generating a notification.

    >>> ubuntu_question = ubuntu.newQuestion(
    ...     sample_person, "Can't install Ubuntu",
    ...    "I insert the install CD in the CD-ROM drive, but it won't boot.",
    ...     do_notify=False)
    >>> notifications = pop_notifications()
    >>> len(notifications)
    0
