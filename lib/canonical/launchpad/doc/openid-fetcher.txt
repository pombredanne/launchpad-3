= Zope Publisher integration with openid.fetchers =

To aid in tests of OpenID discovery, we provide a special
implementation of the openid.fetchers module that talks to the Zope
publisher directly.

It can be installed with the following commands:

    >>> from openid.fetchers import setDefaultFetcher
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests.openidhelpers import PublisherFetcher
    >>> setDefaultFetcher(PublisherFetcher())


== Fetching Documents ==

Once the fetcher is installed, we can talk directly to the Zope
publisher:

    >>> from openid.fetchers import fetch
    >>> response = fetch('http://launchpad.dev/')
    >>> response
    <...HTTPResponse...>
    >>> response.status
    200
    >>> 'content-type' in response.headers
    True
    >>> response.headers['content-type']
    'text/html;charset=utf-8'
    >>> '<html' in response.body
    True


== Redirects ==

The fetch() interface expects HTTP redirects to be followed, which is
handled by the PublisherFetcher:

    >>> response = fetch('http://launchpad.dev/products/firefox')
    >>> response.status
    200
    >>> response.final_url
    'http://launchpad.dev/firefox'


== 404 Errors ==

Not found errors are handled by the publisher and return a 404
response:

    >>> response = fetch('http://launchpad.dev/no-such-file')
    >>> response.status
    404

== Uninstalling the Fetcher ==

Uninstalling the fetcher is achieved with another call to
setDefaultFetcher():

    >>> setDefaultFetcher(None)
