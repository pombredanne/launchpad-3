= Code Imports =

The CodeImport objects model the process surrounding the code import service
of Launchpad. A CodeImport object is created by a user requesting an import,
the import source is then reviewed by privileged users. Then importd, the
code import daemon, performs the initial import and updates it regularly.

We can import code from CVS or Subversion.

== Code import set ==

CodeImports are created and found using the ICodeImport interface, which is
registered as a utility.

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import ICodeImportSet
  >>> from zope.interface.verify import verifyObject
  >>> from zope.component import getUtility
  >>> code_import_set = getUtility(ICodeImportSet)
  >>> verifyObject(ICodeImportSet, code_import_set)
  True

We still need to have a ProductSeries around that the imports will be
associated to:

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IProductSeriesSet
  >>> series = getUtility(IProductSeriesSet).get(1)
  >>> product = series.product

== Supported source systems ==

The rcs_type field, which indicates whether the import is from CVS or
Subversion, takes values from the 'RevisionControlSystems' vocabulary.

  >>> from canonical.lp.dbschema import RevisionControlSystems

== Code import from CVS ==

Code imports from CVS specify the CVSROOT value, and the path to import in the
repository, known as the "module".

  >>> cvs = RevisionControlSystems.CVS
  >>> cvs_root = ':pserver:anonymous@cvs.example.com:/cvsroot'
  >>> cvs_module = 'hello'


  >>> cvs_import = code_import_set.new(name='cvs-test', product=product,
  ...     series=series,
  ...     rcs_type=cvs, cvs_root=cvs_root, cvs_module=cvs_module)

  >>> verifyObject(ICodeImport, cvs_import)
  True

== Code import from Subversion ==

  >>> svn = RevisionControlSystems.SVN
  >>> svn_url = svn://svn.example.com/trunk'

  >>> svn_import = code_import_set.new(name='svn-test', product=product,
  ...     series=series, rcs_type=svn, svn_branch_url=svn_url)

  >>> verifyObject(ICodeImport, svn_import)
  True
