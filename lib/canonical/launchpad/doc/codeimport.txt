= Code Imports =

CodeImport objects model the process surrounding the code import service
of Launchpad. A CodeImport object is created by a user requesting an
import, the import source is then reviewed by privileged users. Then
importd, the code import daemon, performs the initial import that
populates the import branch, and updates it regularly.

We can import code from CVS or Subversion.

CodeImports are hidden from regular users currently.  David Allouche is
a member of the vcs-imports team and can access the objects freely.

    >>> login('david.allouche@canonical.com')


== Code import set utility ==

CodeImports are created and found using the ICodeImportSet interface,
which is registered as a utility.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import ICodeImport, ICodeImportSet
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.webapp.testing import verifyObject
    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from zope.security.proxy import removeSecurityProxy
    >>> code_import_set = getUtility(ICodeImportSet)
    >>> verifyObject(ICodeImportSet, removeSecurityProxy(code_import_set))
    True

CodeImports record who created them, and we're going to pretend that
this is done by 'No Privileges Person'.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IPersonSet
    >>> nopriv = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('no-priv')

CodeImports are associated with a Branch when they are created; this
is how they are linked to a Product.  For the basic tests, we
associate the imports with a new branch for the FireFox project
(arbitrarily many imports can be created for a project).  A helper
function to create these branches makes the tests below easier to
read.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import (
    ...     BranchType, IBranchSet, ILaunchpadCelebrities, IPersonSet,
    ...     IProductSet)
    >>> vcs_imports = getUtility(ILaunchpadCelebrities).vcs_imports
    >>> def new_import_branch(name):
    ...     product = getUtility(IProductSet).getByName('firefox')
    ...     return getUtility(IBranchSet).new(
    ...         BranchType.IMPORTED,
    ...         name, vcs_imports, vcs_imports, product,
    ...         None, 'Import branch')


== Supported source systems ==

The rcs_type field, which indicates whether the import is from CVS or
Subversion, takes values from the 'RevisionControlSystems' vocabulary.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import RevisionControlSystems


=== Import from CVS ===

Code imports from CVS specify the CVSROOT value, and the path to import
in the repository, known as the "module".

    >>> cvs = RevisionControlSystems.CVS
    >>> cvs_root = ':pserver:anonymous@cvs.example.com:/cvsroot'
    >>> cvs_module = 'hello'
    >>> cvs_branch = new_import_branch("trunk-cvs")
    >>> cvs_import = code_import_set.new(
    ...     registrant=nopriv, branch=cvs_branch,
    ...     rcs_type=cvs, cvs_root=cvs_root, cvs_module=cvs_module)
    >>> verifyObject(ICodeImport, removeSecurityProxy(cvs_import))
    True


=== Import from Subversion ===

Code imports from Subversion specify the URL used with "svn checkout" to
retrieve the tree to import.

    >>> svn = RevisionControlSystems.SVN
    >>> svn_url = 'svn://svn.example.com/trunk'
    >>> svn_branch = new_import_branch("trunk-svn")
    >>> svn_import = code_import_set.new(
    ...     registrant=nopriv, branch=svn_branch,
    ...     rcs_type=svn, svn_branch_url=svn_url)
    >>> verifyObject(ICodeImport, removeSecurityProxy(svn_import))
    True


== Creating a CodeImport from existing data ==

The first production code that creates CodeImports will be a sync
script that creates CodeImports from the existing information in the
ProductSeries table.  The only ProductSeries with such information in
the sample data is evolution/trunk.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IProductSeriesSet
    >>> from canonical.lp.dbschema import ImportStatus
    >>> [series] = getUtility(IProductSeriesSet).searchImports(
    ...     importstatus=ImportStatus.PROCESSING)
    >>> series.product.name
    u'evolution'
    >>> series.name
    u'trunk'
    >>> series.cvsroot
    u':pserver:anonymous@anoncvs.gnome.org:/cvs/gnome'
    >>> series.cvsmodule
    u'evolution'

Once we've found the series, creating a new CodeImport with the same
source details is a fairly simple matter.

    >>> from_existing_import = code_import_set.new(
    ...     registrant=vcs_imports, branch=series.import_branch, rcs_type=cvs,
    ...     cvs_root=series.cvsroot, cvs_module=series.cvsmodule)

This CodeImport is associated to the evolution/main ProductSeries
(because the series' import_branch is the branch of the CodeImport):

    >>> from_existing_import.series.name
    u'trunk'


== Retreiving CodeImports ==

You can retrieve all imports with the `getAll` method of ICodeImport.

    >>> svn_import in code_import_set.getAll()
    True

You can also retrive an import by id, which will be used to present the
object view for an import and also by branch, which will be used to
present the import's details on the page of the branch.

    >>> code_import_set.get(svn_import.id).svn_branch_url
    u'svn://svn.example.com/trunk'
    >>> code_import_set.getByBranch(cvs_branch).cvs_root
    u':pserver:anonymous@cvs.example.com:/cvsroot'

Finally, you can search for imports by review status.  For instance,
there is a single sample CodeImport with the "REVIEWED" status:

    >>> from canonical.lp.dbschema import CodeImportReviewStatus
    >>> reviewed_imports = list(code_import_set.search(
    ...     review_status=CodeImportReviewStatus.REVIEWED))
    >>> reviewed_imports
    [<...CodeImport...>]
    >>> reviewed_imports[0].review_status.name
    'REVIEWED'

When you ask for an id that is not present ICodeImportSet.get() raises
canonical.launchpad.interfaces.NotFoundError, rather than some
internal database exception.

    >>> code_import_set.get(-10)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    NotFoundError: -10


== Canonical URLs ==

We've registered the ICodeImportSet utility on the 'code' part of the
site:

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.webapp import canonical_url
    >>> print canonical_url(code_import_set)
    http://code.launchpad.dev/+code-imports

The code imports themselves are viewed under the branch's URL,
however.

    >>> print canonical_url(svn_import.branch)
    http://code.launchpad.dev/~vcs-imports/firefox/trunk-svn
    >>> print canonical_url(svn_import)
    http://code.launchpad.dev/~vcs-imports/firefox/trunk-svn/+code-import


== Security ==

As we've seen above, David has access to all methods defined by
ICodeImport and ICodeImportSet.  During the transitional period,
anonymous and regular users do _not_ have this access.

    >>> login(ANONYMOUS)
    >>> code_import_set.new
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    Unauthorized: (<...CodeImportSet...>, 'new', 'launchpad.View')
    >>> svn_import.id
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    Unauthorized: (<...CodeImport...>, 'id', 'launchpad.View')
    >>> login('no-priv@canonical.com')
    >>> code_import_set.new
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    Unauthorized: (<...CodeImportSet...>, 'new', 'launchpad.View')
    >>> svn_import.id
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    Unauthorized: (<...CodeImport...>, 'id', 'launchpad.View')
