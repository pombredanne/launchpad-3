Get evolution template for Ubuntu Hoary

    >>> import datetime
    >>> import pytz
    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.webapp.testing import verifyObject
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import (
    ...     IDistributionSet, ILanguageSet, IPersonSet, IPOFile,
    ...     IPOTemplateSet, ISourcePackageNameSet)
    >>> sourcepackagenameset = getUtility(ISourcePackageNameSet)
    >>> sourcepackagename = sourcepackagenameset['evolution']
    >>> distributionset = getUtility(IDistributionSet)
    >>> distribution = distributionset['ubuntu']
    >>> series = distribution['hoary']
    >>> potemplateset = getUtility(IPOTemplateSet)
    >>> potemplatesubset = potemplateset.getSubset(
    ...     distroseries=series, sourcepackagename=sourcepackagename)
    >>> potemplate = potemplatesubset['evolution-2.2']
    >>> UTC = pytz.timezone('UTC')

Get Xhosa translation

    >>> pofile = potemplate.getPOFileByLang('xh')
    >>> dummy_pofile = potemplate.getDummyPOFile('pt_BR')

Both implement the IPOFile interface:

    >>> verifyObject(IPOFile, pofile)
    True

    >>> verifyObject(IPOFile, dummy_pofile)
    True

DummyPOFile returns empty SelectResults for getPOTMsgSet* methods,
except for untranslated messages.

    >>> dummy_pofile.getPOTMsgSetTranslated().count()
    0
    >>> dummy_pofile.getPOTMsgSetFuzzy().count()
    0
    >>> dummy_pofile.getPOTMsgSetChangedInLaunchpad().count()
    0
    >>> dummy_pofile.getPOTMsgSetWithNewSuggestions().count()
    0
    >>> dummy_pofile.getPOTMsgSetWithErrors().count()
    0
    >>> dummy_pofile.getPOTMsgSetUntranslated().count()
    22

Get the set of POTMsgSets that are untranslated.

    >>> potmsgsets = list(pofile.getPOTMsgSetUntranslated())
    >>> len(potmsgsets)
    22

Get Spanish translation

    >>> pofile = potemplate.getPOFileByLang('es')

Get the set of POTMsgSets that are untranslated.

    >>> potmsgsets = list(pofile.getPOTMsgSetUntranslated())
    >>> len(potmsgsets)
    13

We need a helper method to better display test results.

    >>> def print_potmsgsets(potmsgsets, pofile=None):
    ...     for potmsgset in potmsgsets:
    ...         singular = plural = None
    ...         translation = ""
    ...         if potmsgset.singular_text:
    ...             singular = potmsgset.singular_text
    ...             if len(singular) > 20:
    ...                singular = singular[:17] + "..."
    ...         if potmsgset.plural_text:
    ...             plural = potmsgset.plural_text
    ...             if len(plural) > 20:
    ...                plural = plural[:17] + "..."
    ...         if pofile is not None:
    ...             translation = potmsgset.getCurrentTranslationMessage(
    ...                 pofile.language, pofile.variant).translations[0]
    ...             if len(translation) > 20:
    ...                 translation = translation[:17] + "..."
    ...         print "%2d. %-20s   %-20s   %-20s" % (
    ...             potmsgset.sequence, singular, plural, translation)


== findPOTMsgSetsContaining ==

It is common to want to find those POTMsgSets which contain a certain
substring in their original English string.

    >>> found_potmsgsets = (
    ...     dummy_pofile.findPOTMsgSetsContaining(u"contact"))
    >>> found_potmsgsets.count()
    4
    >>> print_potmsgsets(found_potmsgsets)
     7. contact's header:      None
    14. The location and ...   None
    15. %d contact             %d contacts
    16. Opening %d contac...   Opening %d contac...

Search is case-insensitive.

    >>> found_potmsgsets = (
    ...     dummy_pofile.findPOTMsgSetsContaining(u"CONTact"))
    >>> found_potmsgsets.count()
    4
    >>> print_potmsgsets(found_potmsgsets)
     7. contact's header:      None
    14. The location and ...   None
    15. %d contact             %d contacts
    16. Opening %d contac...   Opening %d contac...

Search will look through plural msgids as well.

    >>> found_potmsgsets = (
    ...     dummy_pofile.findPOTMsgSetsContaining(u"contacts"))
    >>> found_potmsgsets.count()
    2
    >>> print_potmsgsets(found_potmsgsets)
    15. %d contact             %d contacts
    16. Opening %d contac...   Opening %d contac...

Looking for a non-existing string returns an empty SelectResults.

    >>> found_potmsgsets = (
    ...     dummy_pofile.findPOTMsgSetsContaining(u"non-existing-string"))
    >>> found_potmsgsets.count()
    0

Trying to find a string shorter than two characters doesn't work.

    >>> found_potmsgsets = (
    ...     dummy_pofile.findPOTMsgSetsContaining(u"a"))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    AssertionError: You can not search for strings shorter than 2 characters.

In a Spanish translation, you will also get matching translations.

    >>> found_potmsgsets = (
    ...     pofile.findPOTMsgSetsContaining(u"ventana"))
    >>> found_potmsgsets.count()
    1
    >>> print_potmsgsets(found_potmsgsets, pofile)
    16. Opening %d contac...   Opening %d contac...   Abrir %d contacto...

Searching for translations is case insensitive.

    >>> found_potmsgsets = (
    ...     pofile.findPOTMsgSetsContaining(u"VENTANA"))
    >>> found_potmsgsets.count()
    1
    >>> print_potmsgsets(found_potmsgsets, pofile)
    16. Opening %d contac...   Opening %d contac...   Abrir %d contacto...

However, searching for plural forms other than the first one doesn't work.

    >>> found_potmsgsets = (
    ...     pofile.findPOTMsgSetsContaining(u"estos"))
    >>> found_potmsgsets.count()
    0

One can find a message by looking for a suggestion (non-current translation).

    >>> found_potmsgsets = (
    ...     pofile.findPOTMsgSetsContaining(u"tarjetas"))
    >>> found_potmsgsets.count()
    1
    >>> print_potmsgsets(found_potmsgsets, pofile)
     5.  cards                 None                    caratas

== path ==

A PO file has a storage path that determines where the file is to be
stored in a filesystem tree (such as an export tarball).  The path
ends with the actual file name and should include a language code.

    >>> pofile_xh = potemplate.getPOFileByLang('xh')
    >>> pofile_xh.path
    u'xh.po'

To change this path, use setPathIfUnique().

    >>> pofile_xh.setPathIfUnique('xh2.po')
    >>> pofile_xh.path
    u'xh2.po'

The path must be unique within its distribution series package or
product release series, so that a single file system tree can contain
all translations found there.

If the given path is not locally unique, setPathIfUnique() simply does
nothing.  There can be no naming conflict in that case because the PO
file's existing path is already supposed to be unique.

Here we try to copy the path of another translation of the same template
but the PO file correctly retains its original path.

    >>> pofile_xh.setPathIfUnique(pofile.path)
    >>> pofile_xh.path
    u'xh2.po'


== updateHeader() ==

This method is used to update the header of the POFile to a newer version.

This is the new header we are going to apply.

    >>> new_header_string = '''Project-Id-Version: es
    ... POT-Creation-Date: 2004-08-18 11:10+0200
    ... PO-Revision-Date: 2005-08-18 13:22+0000
    ... Last-Translator: Carlos Perell\xc3\xb3 Mar\xc3\xadn <carlos@canonical.com>
    ... Language-Team: Spanish <traductores@es.gnome.org>
    ... MIME-Version: 1.0
    ... Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
    ... Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
    ... Report-Msgid-Bugs-To: serrador@hispalinux.es'''

We can get an ITranslationHeaderData from the file format importer.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import ITranslationImporter
    >>> translation_importer = getUtility(ITranslationImporter)
    >>> format_importer = translation_importer.getTranslationFormatImporter(
    ...     pofile.potemplate.source_file_format)
    >>> new_header = format_importer.getHeaderFromString(new_header_string)
    >>> new_header.comment = ' This is the top comment.'

Before doing any change, we can see what's right now in the database:

    >>> pofile.topcomment.splitlines()[:2]
    [u' traducci\xf3n de es.po al Spanish',
     u' translation of es.po to Spanish']

    >>> print pofile.header
    Project-Id-Version: es
    POT-Creation-Date: 2004-08-17 11:10+0200
    PO-Revision-Date: 2005-04-07 13:22+0000
    ...
    Plural-Forms: nplurals=2; plural=(n != 1);

Let's update the header with the new one.

    >>> pofile.updateHeader(new_header)

The new comment is now applied.

    >>> pofile.topcomment
    u' This is the top comment.'

And the new header contains the new string.

    >>> print pofile.header
    Project-Id-Version: es
    Report-Msgid-Bugs-To: serrador@hispalinux.es
    POT-Creation-Date: 2004-08-18 11:10+0200
    PO-Revision-Date: 2005-08-18 13:22+0000
    ...


== isTranslationRevisionDateOlder ==

This method helps to compare two PO files header and decide if the given one
is older than the one we have in the IPOFile object. We are using this
method, for instance, to know if a new imported PO file should be ignored
because we already have a newer one.

This test is to be sure that the date comparation is working and that two
headers with the same date will always be set as newer, because lazy
translators forget to update that field from time to time and sometimes, we
were losing translations because we were ignoring those imports too.

    >>> print pofile.header
    Project-Id-Version: es
    ...
    PO-Revision-Date: 2005-08-18 13:22+0000
    ...
    >>> header = pofile.getHeader()

First, with the same date, we don't consider it older.

    >>> pofile.isTranslationRevisionDateOlder(header)
    False

Now, we can see how we detect that it's older with an older date.

    >>> header.translation_revision_date = datetime.datetime(
    ...     2005, 8, 18, 13, 21, tzinfo=UTC)
    >>> pofile.isTranslationRevisionDateOlder(header)
    True


If the revision date of the stored translation file is missing, the new
one is considered an update.

    >>> from zope.security.proxy import removeSecurityProxy
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.translationformat.gettext_po_parser import (
    ...     POHeader)

    >>> old_pofile = removeSecurityProxy(potemplate.newPOFile('tl'))
    >>> old_pofile.header = """
    ...     Project-Id-Version: foo
    ...     MIME-Version: 1.0
    ...     Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
    ...     Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
    ...     """
    >>> new_header = POHeader("""
    ...     Project-Id-Version: foo
    ...     PO-Revision-Date: 2007-05-03 14:00+0200
    ...     MIME-Version: 1.0
    ...     Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
    ...     Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
    ...     """)

    >>> old_pofile.isTranslationRevisionDateOlder(new_header)
    False


This even goes if the new file also omits the revision date.

    >>> new_header = POHeader("""
    ...     Project-Id-Version: foo
    ...     MIME-Version: 1.0
    ...     Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
    ...     Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
    ...     """)
    >>> old_pofile.isTranslationRevisionDateOlder(new_header)
    False


== canEditTranslations ==

This method determines if someone is allowed to edit translations.

Do some needed imports.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import ILaunchpadCelebrities
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IProductSet
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import ITranslationGroupSet
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import TranslationPermission
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import POFile
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests import login
    >>> person_set = getUtility(IPersonSet)

Need extra permissions to change the values.

    >>> login('carlos@canonical.com')

Set a translation group to test the CLOSED mode. This mode allows translations
only from the teams set as official translators.

    >>> product = getUtility(IProductSet).getByName('evolution')
    >>> translation_group_set = getUtility(ITranslationGroupSet)
    >>> product.translationgroup = translation_group_set[
    ...     'testing-translation-team']
    >>> product.translationpermission = TranslationPermission.CLOSED

Get the IPOFile we are going to use.

    >>> product_series = product.translatable_series[0]
    >>> potemplate = product_series.getPOTemplate('evolution-2.2')
    >>> pofile_es = potemplate.getPOFileByLang('es')

A Launchpad admin must have permission always.

    >>> admins = getUtility(ILaunchpadCelebrities).admin
    >>> pofile_es.canEditTranslations(admins)
    True

A Rosetta Expert too.

    >>> rosetta_experts = getUtility(ILaunchpadCelebrities).rosetta_experts
    >>> pofile_es.canEditTranslations(rosetta_experts)
    True

And Valentina Commissari, as member of the Spanish translation team for
evolution should also have rights.

    >>> valentina = person_set.getByName('tsukimi')
    >>> pofile_es.canEditTranslations(valentina)
    True

But the unprivileged account should not.

    >>> no_priv = person_set.getByName('no-priv')
    >>> pofile_es.canEditTranslations(no_priv)
    False

And if he tries to update translations, the system blocks such
breakage.

    >>> translation_message = pofile_es.getCurrentTranslationMessage(
    ...     u'evolution addressbook')
    >>> is_fuzzy = False
    >>> is_imported = False
    >>> lock_timestamp = datetime.datetime.now(UTC)
    >>> translation_message.potmsgset.updateTranslation(
    ...     pofile_es, no_priv, [u'foo'], is_fuzzy, is_imported, lock_timestamp)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    AssertionError: No Privileges Person cannot add translations nor can...


Now, we get an IPOFile that does not have a translation team assigned.

    >>> pofile_cy = potemplate.getDummyPOFile('cy')

Valentina Commissari is not a translator for this language and does not
have permissions.

    >>> pofile_cy.canEditTranslations(valentina)
    False

And same thing with the unprivileged account.

    >>> pofile_cy.canEditTranslations(no_priv)
    False

RESTRICTED mode is the same as CLOSED when restricting who is able to change
translations.

    >>> product.translationpermission = TranslationPermission.RESTRICTED

A Launchpad admin must have permission always.

    >>> pofile_es.canEditTranslations(admins)
    True

A Translations Expert too.

    >>> pofile_es.canEditTranslations(rosetta_experts)
    True

And Valentina Commissari, as member of the Spanish translation team for
evolution should also have rights.

    >>> pofile_es.canEditTranslations(valentina)
    True

But the unprivileged account should not.

    >>> pofile_es.canEditTranslations(no_priv)
    False

Valentina Commissari still doesn't have permissions to edit translations for
Welsh (cy).

    >>> pofile_cy.canEditTranslations(valentina)
    False

And same thing with the unprivileged account.

    >>> pofile_cy.canEditTranslations(no_priv)
    False

Now, let's test the STRUCTURED mode. In this mode, only the defined
translation teams can translate like the RESTRICTED and CLOSED mode, but in
addition, if we don't have any language team for one language, anyone can
add translations.

    >>> product.translationpermission = TranslationPermission.STRUCTURED

Valentina Commissari, as member of the Spanish translation team for
evolution should have rights for the Spanish IPOFile.

    >>> pofile_es.canEditTranslations(valentina)
    True

But the unprivileged account should not.

    >>> pofile_es.canEditTranslations(no_priv)
    False

And this is the difference with the CLOSED mode, anyone will be able to
translate into Welsh, as we can see with Valentina:

    >>> pofile_cy.canEditTranslations(valentina)
    True

And same thing with the unprivileged account.

    >>> pofile_cy.canEditTranslations(no_priv)
    True

Finally, let's check the OPEN mode to be 100% sure that in that mode
anyone can do translations.

    >>> product.translationgroup = None
    >>> product.translationpermission = TranslationPermission.OPEN

We don't have any translation group for the Evolution product so there are
no translators assigned to it, but Valentina Commissari still has rights to
do translations.

    >>> pofile_es.canEditTranslations(valentina)
    True

And samething with the unprivileged account.

    >>> pofile_es.canEditTranslations(no_priv)
    True


== canAddSuggestions ==

This method determines if someone is allowed to add suggestions.

Set a translation group to test the CLOSED mode. This mode allows translations
only from the teams set as official translators.

    >>> product.translationgroup = translation_group_set[
    ...     'testing-translation-team']
    >>> product.translationpermission = TranslationPermission.CLOSED

A Launchpad admin must have permission always.

    >>> pofile_es.canAddSuggestions(admins)
    True

A Translations Expert too.

    >>> pofile_es.canAddSuggestions(rosetta_experts)
    True

And Valentina Commissari, as member of the Spanish translation team for
evolution should also have rights.

    >>> pofile_es.canAddSuggestions(valentina)
    True

But the unprivileged account should not.

    >>> pofile_es.canAddSuggestions(no_priv)
    False

RESTRICTED, STRUCTURED and OPEN modes are different from CLOSED mode when
handling suggestions because it allows anyone to add suggestions.

    >>> def canAddSuggestionsCheck(translation_mode):
    ...     product.translationpermission = translation_mode
    ...     assert pofile_es.canAddSuggestions(admins), (
    ...         'Administrators are not able to add suggestions!')
    ...     assert pofile_es.canAddSuggestions(rosetta_experts), (
    ...         'Translation experts are not able to add suggestions!')
    ...     assert pofile_es.canAddSuggestions(no_priv), (
    ...         'A plain user is not able to add suggestions!')
    ...     return True

    >>> canAddSuggestionsCheck(TranslationPermission.RESTRICTED)
    True
    >>> canAddSuggestionsCheck(TranslationPermission.STRUCTURED)
    True
    >>> canAddSuggestionsCheck(TranslationPermission.OPEN)
    True

    Leave the permission back to OPEN.
    >>> product.translationpermission = TranslationPermission.OPEN

== plural_forms ==

This method returns a number of plural forms for the language of the POFile,
or a default of 2 when language doesn't specify it: 2 is the most common
value for number of plural forms, so most likely to be correct for any new
language.  Even if the default value is incorrect, it is handled gracefully
by the rest of the system (see doc/poimport.txt for example).

When the language has number of plural forms defined, that value is used.

    >>> evolution = getUtility(IProductSet).getByName('evolution')
    >>> evolution_trunk = evolution.getSeries('trunk')
    >>> evolution_pot = evolution_trunk.getPOTemplate('evolution-2.2')
    >>> serbian = getUtility(ILanguageSet)['sr']
    >>> serbian.pluralforms
    3
    >>> evolution_sr = evolution_pot.getDummyPOFile(serbian.code)
    >>> evolution_sr.plural_forms
    3

And when a language has no plural forms defined, a POFile defaults to 2,
the most common number of plural forms:

    >>> divehi = getUtility(ILanguageSet)['dv']
    >>> print divehi.pluralforms
    None
    >>> evolution_dv = evolution_pot.getDummyPOFile(divehi.code)
    >>> evolution_dv.plural_forms
    2

== export ==

This method serializes an IPOFile as a .po file.

Get a concrete POFile we know doesn't have a UTF-8 encoding.

    >>> pofile = POFile.get(24)
    >>> print pofile.header
    Project-Id-Version: PACKAGE VERSION
    ...
    Content-Type: text/plain; charset=EUC-JP
    ...

Now, let's export it with its default encoding.

    >>> stream = pofile.export()
    >>> stream_list = stream.splitlines()

The header is not changed.

    >>> for i in range(len(stream_list)):
    ...     if stream_list[i].startswith('"Content-Type:'):
    ...         print stream_list[i]
    "Content-Type: text/plain; charset=EUC-JP\n"

And checking one of the translations, we can see that it's using the EUC-JP
encoding.

    >>> for i in range(len(stream_list)):
    ...     if (stream_list[i].startswith('msgstr') and
    ...         'prefs.js' in stream_list[i]):
    ...         break
    >>> stream_list[i]
    'msgstr "\xc0\xdf\xc4\xea\xa4\xce\xa5\xab\xa5\xb9\xa5\xbf\xa5\xde\xa5\xa4\xa5\xba\xa4\xcb /etc/mozilla/prefs.js \xa4\xac\xcd\xf8\xcd\xd1\xa4\xc7\xa4\xad\xa4\xde\xa4\xb9\xa1\xa3"'


Now, let's force the UTF-8 encoding.

    >>> stream = pofile.export(force_utf8=True)
    >>> stream_list = stream.splitlines()

We can see that the header has been updated to have UTF-8

    >>> for i in range(len(stream_list)):
    ...     if stream_list[i].startswith('"Content-Type:'):
    ...         print stream_list[i]
    "Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8\n"

And the encoding used is also using UTF-8 chars.

    >>> for i in range(len(stream_list)):
    ...     if (stream_list[i].startswith('msgstr') and
    ...         'prefs.js' in stream_list[i]):
    ...         break
    >>> stream_list[i]
    'msgstr "\xe8\xa8\xad\xe5\xae\x9a\xe3\x81\xae\xe3\x82\xab\xe3\x82\xb9\xe3\x82\xbf\xe3\x83\x9e\xe3\x82\xa4\xe3\x82\xba\xe3\x81\xab /etc/mozilla/prefs.js \xe3\x81\x8c\xe5\x88\xa9\xe7\x94\xa8\xe3\x81\xa7\xe3\x81\x8d\xe3\x81\xbe\xe3\x81\x99\xe3\x80\x82"'

There are some situations when a msgid_plural changes, while the msgid
singular remains unchanged.

So for a concrete export, we have a message like:

    >>> print pofile_es.export(force_utf8=True).decode('utf8')
    # traducci...
    ...
    #: addressbook/gui/widgets/foo.c:345
    #, fuzzy, c-format
    msgid "%d foo"
    msgid_plural "%d bars"
    msgstr[0] "%d foo"
    ...

When it changes...

    >>> potmsgset = potemplate.getPOTMsgSetByMsgIDText(
    ...     u'%d foo')

    # It has plural forms.
    >>> print potmsgset.plural_text
    %d bars

    # We change the plural form.
    >>> potmsgset.updatePluralForm(u'something else')
    >>> from canonical.database.sqlbase import flush_database_updates
    >>> flush_database_updates()
    >>> print potmsgset.plural_text
    something else

...the export reflects that change.

    >>> print pofile_es.export(force_utf8=True).decode('utf8')
    # traducci...
    ...
    #: addressbook/gui/widgets/foo.c:345
    #, fuzzy, c-format

== getPOTMsgSetUntranslated ==

The POTMsgSet that are untranslated are the ones that are not complete and
that aren't fuzzy.

If a POTMsgSet doesn't have a POMsgSet for a concrete translation, we take
that as not bein complete too.

    >>> untranslated_potmsgset = pofile_es.getPOTMsgSetUntranslated()
    >>> untranslated_potmsgset.count()
    13

    >>> for potmsgset in untranslated_potmsgset:
    ...     pomsgset = potmsgset.getCurrentTranslationMessage(
    ...         pofile_es.language)
    ...     assert (pomsgset is None or
    ...             (pomsgset.iscomplete == False and
    ...              pomsgset.isfuzzy == False))


== createMessageSetFromText ==

This method returns a new IPOMsgSet for the associated text.

Let's get the IPOFile we are going to use for this test.

    >>> pofile_sr = potemplate.newPOFile('sr')

And the msgid we are looking for.

    >>> msgid = u'Found %i invalid file.'

Now, just to be sure that this entry doesn't exist yet:

    >>> pofile_sr.getCurrentTranslationMessage(msgid).translations
    [None, None, None]

Is time to create it.

    >>> potmsgset = pofile_sr.potemplate.getPOTMsgSetByMsgIDText(msgid)
    >>> translations = {0: u''}
    >>> is_fuzzy = False
    >>> is_imported = False
    >>> lock_timestamp = datetime.datetime.now(UTC)
    >>> translation_message = potmsgset.updateTranslation(
    ...     pofile_sr, rosetta_experts, translations, is_fuzzy, is_imported,
    ...     lock_timestamp)

As we can see, is the msgid we were looking for.

    >>> print translation_message.potmsgset.msgid_singular.msgid
    Found %i invalid file.
    >>> print pofile_sr.language.code
    sr
    >>> print translation_message.pofile.language.code
    sr

This entry is in fact one that is not used anymore, that means, its sequence
is zero.

    >>> translation_message.potmsgset.sequence
    0

Also, we created it without translations.

    >>> translation_message.translations
    [None, None, None]


== getPOTMsgSetChangedInLaunchpad ==

This method returns only those POTMsgSet's which contain translation
submissions through Launchpad which change existing published translations.

Lets get Evolution Spanish translation in distribution Hoary.

    >>> sourcepackagenameset = getUtility(ISourcePackageNameSet)
    >>> sourcepackagename = sourcepackagenameset['evolution']
    >>> distributionset = getUtility(IDistributionSet)
    >>> distribution = distributionset['ubuntu']
    >>> release = distribution['hoary']
    >>> potemplateset = getUtility(IPOTemplateSet)
    >>> potemplatesubset = potemplateset.getSubset(
    ...     distroseries=release, sourcepackagename=sourcepackagename)
    >>> potemplate = potemplatesubset['evolution-2.2']
    >>> pofile_changed = potemplate.getPOFileByLang('es')

This translation file already contains one message which has been changed in
Launchpad.

    >>> potmsgsets = list(pofile_changed.getPOTMsgSetChangedInLaunchpad())
    >>> len(potmsgsets)
    1
    >>> stats = pofile_changed.updateStatistics()
    >>> print pofile_changed.updatesCount()
    1

This message is also counted as translated message (number of translated
messages is the number of imported/currentCount plus number of newly
translated in Launchpad/rosettaCount plus number of changed in
Launchpad/updatesCount):

    >>> print pofile_changed.currentCount()
    7
    >>> print pofile_changed.rosettaCount()
    0
    >>> print pofile_changed.updatesCount()
    1

We make sure that submissions on untranslated strings are not considered
'changed in Launchpad', since this method is mainly designed to help
translators revert translations to published translations.

Lets get a single untranslated POTMsgSet.

    >>> untranslated = list(pofile_changed.getPOTMsgSetUntranslated())[0]
    >>> untranslated is None
    False
    >>> current = untranslated.getCurrentTranslationMessage(
    ...     pofile_changed.language)
    >>> current is None
    True
    >>> imported = untranslated.getImportedTranslationMessage(
    ...     pofile_changed.language)
    >>> imported is None
    True

Now, lets provide a translation for it.

    >>> translation_message = untranslated.updateTranslation(pofile_changed,
    ...     pofile_changed.owner, {0: u'sample translation'}, is_fuzzy=False,
    ...     is_imported=False, lock_timestamp=datetime.datetime.now(UTC))

And make sure that the count of changed in Launchpad hasn't changed.

    >>> potmsgsets = list(pofile_changed.getPOTMsgSetChangedInLaunchpad())
    >>> len(potmsgsets)
    1
    >>> stats = pofile_changed.updateStatistics()
    >>> print pofile_changed.updatesCount()
    1

Now, lets change translation for a message which already has an imported
translation.  First we need to find a message with current, imported
translation:

    >>> for potmsgset in pofile_changed.potemplate:
    ...     tm = potmsgset.getImportedTranslationMessage(
    ...         pofile_changed.language)
    ...     if tm is not None and tm.is_complete and tm.is_current:
    ...         imported_potmsgset = potmsgset
    ...         break
    >>> potmsgset is None
    False

Lets re-translate that:

    >>> translation_message = imported_potmsgset.updateTranslation(
    ...     pofile_changed, pofile_changed.owner, {0: u'new translation'},
    ...     is_fuzzy=False, is_imported=False,
    ...     lock_timestamp=datetime.datetime.now(UTC))
    >>> from canonical.database.sqlbase import flush_database_caches
    >>> flush_database_caches()

And make sure that the count of messages changed in Launchpad _has_ changed:

    >>> potmsgsets = list(pofile_changed.getPOTMsgSetChangedInLaunchpad())
    >>> len(potmsgsets)
    2

Lets check that the updatesCount() is also properly updated.

    >>> stats = pofile_changed.updateStatistics()
    >>> pofile_changed.updatesCount()
    2


== getPOTMsgSetWithNewSuggestions ==

This method returns only those POTMsgSet's which contain suggestions
submitted after the last review date, or, in other words, those
suggestions which need to be reviewed.

Lets get Evolution Spanish translation in distribution Hoary.

    >>> person_set = getUtility(IPersonSet)
    >>> potemplateset = getUtility(IPOTemplateSet)
    >>> evolution = getUtility(IProductSet).getByName('evolution')
    >>> evolution_trunk = evolution.getSeries('trunk')
    >>> potemplatesubset = potemplateset.getSubset(productseries=evolution_trunk)
    >>> evolution_template = potemplatesubset['evolution-2.2']
    >>> evolution_es = evolution_template.getPOFileByLang('es')

    >>> noneditor = person_set.getByName('no-priv')
    >>> editor = person_set.getByName('carlos')

    # Make sure the translation permission mode is restricted
    >>> product.translationpermission = TranslationPermission.RESTRICTED

Non-editor can only submit a new suggestion on untranslated message.

    >>> evolution_es.getPOTMsgSetWithNewSuggestions().count()
    2
    >>> stats = evolution_es.updateStatistics()
    >>> print evolution_es.unreviewedCount()
    2

    >>> potmsgset = evolution_es.potemplate.getPOTMsgSetByMsgIDText(
    ...     u'evolution minicard')
    >>> current = potmsgset.getCurrentTranslationMessage(evolution_es.language)

    # Make sure this entry is unreviewed and untranslated
    >>> print current
    None

    >>> new_translation = potmsgset.updateTranslation(
    ...     evolution_es, noneditor, {0: u'translation'}, is_fuzzy=False,
    ...     is_imported=False, lock_timestamp=datetime.datetime.now(UTC))
    >>> flush_database_caches() # Store modification dates in database
    >>> print new_translation.translations
    [u'translation']
    >>> new_translation.is_current
    False
    >>> current = potmsgset.getCurrentTranslationMessage(evolution_es.language)
    >>> print current
    None

    >>> evolution_es.getPOTMsgSetWithNewSuggestions().count()
    3
    >>> stats = evolution_es.updateStatistics()
    >>> print evolution_es.unreviewedCount()
    3

A privileged translator can approve this same suggestion by submitting
it himself.

    >>> new_translation = potmsgset.updateTranslation(
    ...     evolution_es, editor, {0: u'translation'}, is_fuzzy=False,
    ...     is_imported=False, lock_timestamp=datetime.datetime.now(UTC))
    >>> flush_database_caches() # Store modification dates in database
    >>> current = potmsgset.getCurrentTranslationMessage(evolution_es.language)
    >>> print current.translations
    [u'translation']
    >>> evolution_es.getPOTMsgSetWithNewSuggestions().count()
    2
    >>> stats = evolution_es.updateStatistics()
    >>> print evolution_es.unreviewedCount()
    2

Or, they can update it with entirely different translation, which won't be
picked up as a new suggestion, but will be directly set as the translation.

    >>> new_translation = potmsgset.updateTranslation(
    ...     evolution_es, editor, {0: u'boohoo'}, is_fuzzy=False,
    ...     is_imported=False, lock_timestamp=datetime.datetime.now(UTC))
    >>> flush_database_caches() # Store modification dates in database
    >>> current = potmsgset.getCurrentTranslationMessage(evolution_es.language)
    >>> print current.translations
    [u'boohoo']
    >>> evolution_es.getPOTMsgSetWithNewSuggestions().count()
    2
    >>> stats = evolution_es.updateStatistics()
    >>> print evolution_es.unreviewedCount()
    2

Non-editors can still provide suggestions on messages with approved
translations, and this will again list this message among those with
new suggestions.

    >>> potmsgset = evolution_es.potemplate.getPOTMsgSetByMsgIDText(
    ...     u'have ')
    >>> current = potmsgset.getCurrentTranslationMessage(evolution_es.language)
    >>> print current.translations
    [u'tiene ']

    >>> new_translation = potmsgset.updateTranslation(
    ...     evolution_es, noneditor, {0: u'blahblah'}, is_fuzzy=False,
    ...     is_imported=False, lock_timestamp=datetime.datetime.now(UTC))
    >>> current = potmsgset.getCurrentTranslationMessage(evolution_es.language)
    >>> print current.translations
    [u'tiene ']
    >>> evolution_es.getPOTMsgSetWithNewSuggestions().count()
    3
    >>> stats = evolution_es.updateStatistics()
    >>> print evolution_es.unreviewedCount()
    3

And if we've got two new suggestions for the same message, POTMsgSet
will not be listed twice in the returned result.

    >>> new_translation = potmsgset.updateTranslation(
    ...     evolution_es, noneditor, {0: u'another'}, is_fuzzy=False,
    ...     is_imported=False, lock_timestamp=datetime.datetime.now(UTC))
    >>> evolution_es.getPOTMsgSetWithNewSuggestions().count()
    3
    >>> len(set(evolution_es.getPOTMsgSetWithNewSuggestions()))
    3


== getPOTMsgSetTranslated ==

With this method we can get all POTMsgSet objects that are fully
translated for a given POFile.

    >>> def print_message_status(potmsgsets, language):
    ...     print "%-10s %-5s %-10s %-9s %-11s" % (
    ...         "msgid", "form", "translat.", "fuzzy", "Has plurals")
    ...     for potmsgset in potmsgsets:
    ...         translationmessage = potmsgset.getCurrentTranslationMessage(
    ...             language)
    ...         for index in range(len(translationmessage.translations)):
    ...             msgid = potmsgset.msgid_singular.msgid
    ...             if len(msgid) > 10:
    ...                 msgid = msgid[:7] + '...'
    ...             if translationmessage.translations[index] is None:
    ...                 translation = 'None'
    ...             else:
    ...                 translation = translationmessage.translations[index]
    ...                 if len(translation) > 10:
    ...                     translation = translation[:7] + '...'
    ...             print "%-10s %-5s %-10s %-9s %-11s" % (
    ...                 msgid, index, translation,
    ...                 translationmessage.is_fuzzy,
    ...                 potmsgset.msgid_plural is not None)

    >>> potmsgsets_translated = evolution_es.getPOTMsgSetTranslated()
    >>> print_message_status(
    ...     potmsgsets_translated, evolution_es.language)
    msgid      form  translat.  fuzzy     Has plurals
    evoluti... 0     libreta... False     False

    Opening... 1     Abrir %... False     True
    EncFS P... 0     Contras... False     False


== getPOTMsgSetFuzzy ==

This method returns all POTMsgSet for a given POFile that have its
current TranslationMessage with is_fuzzy flag set.

    >>> potmsgsets_fuzzy = evolution_es.getPOTMsgSetFuzzy()
    >>> print_message_status(potmsgsets_fuzzy, evolution_es.language)
    msgid      form  translat.  fuzzy     Has plurals
    %d foo     0     %d foo     True      True
    %d foo     1     None       True      True

And when we submit another translation that is fuzzy...

    >>> potmsgset_to_change = potmsgsets_fuzzy[0]
    >>> new_translationmessage = potmsgset_to_change.updateTranslation(
    ...     evolution_es, editor, {0: u'something'}, is_fuzzy=True,
    ...     is_imported=False, lock_timestamp=datetime.datetime.now(UTC))

... we get only the new one, which is fuzzy

    >>> potmsgsets_fuzzy = evolution_es.getPOTMsgSetFuzzy()
    >>> print_message_status(potmsgsets_fuzzy, evolution_es.language)
    msgid      form  translat.  fuzzy     Has plurals
    %d foo     0     something  True      True
    %d foo     1     None       True      True

== getTranslationsFilteredBy ==

This method returns a list of TranslationMessages in a given POFile
created by a certain person.

    >>> carlos = person_set.getByName('carlos')
    >>> translationmessages = evolution_es.getTranslationsFilteredBy(carlos)
    >>> for translationmessage in translationmessages:
    ...     print translationmessage.translations
    [u'libreta de direcciones de Evolution']
    [u'carpeta de libretas de direcciones actual']
    [u'lalalala']
    [u'tiene ']
    [u' tarjetas']
    [u'boohoo']
    [u'La ubicaci\xf3n y jerarqu\xeda de las carpetas de contactos de Evolution ha cambiado desde Evolution 1.x.\n\nTenga paciencia mientras Evolution migra sus carpetas...']
    [u'%d contacto', u'%d contactos']
    [u'Abrir %d contacto abrir\xe1 %d ventanas nuevas tambi\xe9n.\n\xbfQuiere realmente mostrar este contacto?', u'Abrir %d contactos abrir\xe1 %d ventanas nuevas tambi\xe9n.\n\xbfQuiere realmente mostrar todos estos contactos?']
    [u'something', None]
    [u'%d foo', None]
    [u'Contrase\xf1a de EncFS: ']
    [u'_A\xf1adir grupo']

If the passed person is None, the call fails with an assertion.

    >>> translationmessages = evolution_es.getTranslationsFilteredBy(None)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    AssertionError: You must provide a person to filter by.

== Translation credits ==

Translation credits are handled automatically, and cannot be
translated in any other way except through a published upload.

Lets get Spanish translation for alsa-utils.

    >>> alsautils = getUtility(IProductSet).getByName('alsa-utils')
    >>> alsa_trunk = alsautils.getSeries('trunk')
    >>> alsa_template = alsa_trunk.getPOTemplate('alsa-utils')
    >>> alsa_translation = alsa_template.newPOFile('sr')
    >>> alsa_translation.owner = editor

This translation file contains untranslated translation-credits message.

    >>> potmsgset = alsa_template.getPOTMsgSetByMsgIDText(
    ...     u'translation-credits')
    >>> current = potmsgset.getCurrentTranslationMessage(
    ...     alsa_translation.language)
    >>> print current
    None

If we submit a published translation, the translation for this message
is updated.

    >>> new_credits = potmsgset.updateTranslation(
    ...     alsa_translation, alsa_translation.owner, {0: u'Happy translator'},
    ...     is_fuzzy=False, is_imported=True,
    ...     lock_timestamp=datetime.datetime.now(UTC))
    >>> flush_database_updates()
    >>> current = potmsgset.getCurrentTranslationMessage(
    ...     alsa_translation.language)
    >>> print current.translations
    [u'Happy translator']

If we submit non-published translation, it's refused.

    >>> no_credits = potmsgset.updateTranslation(
    ...     alsa_translation, alsa_translation.owner,
    ...     {0: u'Unhappy translator'}, is_fuzzy=False, is_imported=False,
    ...     lock_timestamp=datetime.datetime.now(UTC))
    >>> print no_credits
    None
    >>> flush_database_updates()
    >>> current = potmsgset.getCurrentTranslationMessage(
    ...     alsa_translation.language)
    >>> print current.translations
    [u'Happy translator']

In automatically generated credits, alsa_translation.owner is now
credited as well.

    >>> potmsgset = alsa_template.getPOTMsgSetByMsgIDText(
    ...     u'translation-credits')
    >>> alsa_translation.prepareTranslationCredits(
    ...     potmsgset)
    u'Happy translator\n\nLaunchpad Contributions:\n  Carlos Perell\xf3 Mar\xedn http://launchpad.dev/~carlos'

Emails of translators is not yet translated.

    >>> emails_of_translators = alsa_template.getPOTMsgSetByMsgIDText(
    ...     u"_: EMAIL OF TRANSLATORS\nYour emails")
    >>> current = emails_of_translators.getCurrentTranslationMessage(
    ...     alsa_translation.language)
    >>> print current
    None

But now credits Carlos when prepared automatically.  Two empty emails are
added to make formatting nicer (first one is used as a separation
between package and Launchpad contributors, and second is empty email
for 'Launchpad Contributions' title; see bug #133817 for details).

    >>> alsa_translation.prepareTranslationCredits(
    ...     emails_of_translators)
    u',,carlos@canonical.com'

Names of translators are untranslated and there is no message set for them yet.

    >>> names_of_translators = alsa_template.getPOTMsgSetByMsgIDText(
    ...     u"_: NAME OF TRANSLATORS\nYour names")
    >>> current = names_of_translators.getCurrentTranslationMessage(
    ...     alsa_translation.language)
    >>> print current
    None

But now names credit Carlos when prepared automatically.  As above, an
empty name is added first to serve as a separator, and "Launchpad
Contributions:" is used as a header for the added credits.

    >>> alsa_translation.prepareTranslationCredits(
    ...     names_of_translators)
    u',Launchpad Contributions:,Carlos Perell\xf3 Mar\xedn'

Lets add a newly supported KDE context message with credit strings
split into two: context and message, instead of a single message with
embedded context.

    >>> new_kde_name_credits = alsa_template.createMessageSetFromText(
    ...     singular_text=u"Your names", plural_text=None,
    ...     context=u"NAME OF TRANSLATORS")

prepareTranslationCredits works on such messages as well:

    >>> alsa_translation.prepareTranslationCredits(new_kde_name_credits)
    u',Launchpad Contributions:,Carlos Perell\xf3 Mar\xedn'

Similar happens for email credits as with name credits.

    >>> new_kde_email_credits = alsa_template.createMessageSetFromText(
    ...     singular_text=u"Your emails", plural_text=None,
    ...     context=u"EMAIL OF TRANSLATORS")
    >>> alsa_translation.prepareTranslationCredits(new_kde_email_credits)
    u',,carlos@canonical.com'


== POFileToTranslationFileDataAdapter ==

POFileToTranslationFileDataAdapter is an adapter to export a POFile
object. It implements the ITranslationFileData interface which is a
common file format in-memory to convert from one file format to
another.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import ITranslationFileData
    >>> evolution_sourcepackagename = sourcepackagenameset['evolution']
    >>> ubuntu = distributionset['ubuntu']
    >>> hoary = ubuntu['hoary']
    >>> potemplatesubset = potemplateset.getSubset(
    ...     distroseries=hoary, sourcepackagename=evolution_sourcepackagename)
    >>> evolution_22 = potemplatesubset['evolution-2.2']
    >>> evolution_ja = evolution_22.getPOFileByLang('ja')

Getting the translation file data is just a matter of adapting the
object to the ITranslationFileData interface.

    >>> translation_file_data = ITranslationFileData(evolution_ja)

We get an updated header based on some metadata in our database
instead of the imported one stored in POFile.header.

    >>> print evolution_ja.header
    Project-Id-Version: evolution
    Report-Msgid-Bugs-To: FULL NAME <EMAIL@ADDRESS>
    POT-Creation-Date: 2005-05-06 20:39:27.778946+00:00

    >>> print translation_file_data.header.getRawContent()
    Project-Id-Version: evolution
    Report-Msgid-Bugs-To: FULL NAME <EMAIL@ADDRESS>
    POT-Creation-Date: 2005-04-07 14:10+0200

    Plural-Forms: nplurals=1; plural=0;
    X-Launchpad-Export-Date: ...-...-... ...:...+...
    X-Generator: Launchpad (build ...)

We can see that last translator is Carlos, just like the updated header
says:

    >>> evolution_ja.lasttranslator.displayname
    u'Carlos Perell\xf3 Mar\xedn'

And the PO Revision Date matches when was the PO file last changed.

    >>> print evolution_ja.date_changed
    2005-10-11 23:08:01.899322+00:00


= POFile Security tests =

Import the function that will help us to do this test.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.webapp.authorization import check_permission

A Launchpad admin must have permission to edit an IPOFile always.

    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')
    >>> check_permission('launchpad.Edit', pofile)
    True

And a Rosetta Expert too.

    >>> login('jordi@ubuntu.com')
    >>> check_permission('launchpad.Edit', pofile)
    True

And that's all, folks!
