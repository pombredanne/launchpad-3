== High Level ==

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import ILibraryFileAliasSet
    >>> from StringIO import StringIO
    >>> data = 'This is some data'

We can create LibraryFileAliases using the ILibraryFileAliasSet utility.
This name is a mouthful, but is consistent with the rest of our naming.

    >>> lfas = getUtility(ILibraryFileAliasSet)
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import NEVER_EXPIRES
    >>> alias = lfas.create(
    ...     'text.txt', len(data), StringIO(data), 'text/plain', NEVER_EXPIRES
    ...     )
    >>> alias.mimetype
    u'text/plain'
    >>> alias.filename
    u'text.txt'

We may wish to set an expiry timestamp on the file. The NEVER_EXPIRES
constant means the file will never be removed from the Librarian, and
because of this should probably never be used.

    >>> alias.expires == NEVER_EXPIRES
    True
    >>> alias = lfas.create(
    ...     'text.txt', len(data), StringIO(data), 'text/plain')

The default expiry of None means the file will expire a few days after
it is no longer referenced in the database.

    >>> alias.expires is None
    True

The creation timestamp of the LibraryFileAlias is available in the
date_created attribute.

    >>> alias.date_created
    datetime.datetime(...)

We can retrieve the LibraryFileAlias we just created using its ID or sha1.

    >>> org_alias_id = alias.id
    >>> alias = lfas[org_alias_id]
    >>> alias.id == org_alias_id
    True

    >>> org_alias_id in [a.id for a in lfas.findBySHA1(alias.content.sha1)]
    True

We can get its URL too

    >>> import re
    >>> re.search(
    ...     r'^http://localhost:58000/\d+/text.txt$', alias.http_url
    ...     ) is not None
    True

Librarian also serves the same file through https.

    >>> re.search(
    ...     r'^https://localhost:58000/\d+/text.txt$', alias.https_url
    ...     ) is not None
    True

And we even have a convenient method which returns either the http URL or the
https one, depending on a config value.

    >>> from canonical.config import config
    >>> config.vhosts.use_https
    False
    >>> re.search(
    ...     r'^http://localhost:58000/\d+/text.txt$', alias.getURL()
    ...     ) is not None
    True

    >>> from textwrap import dedent
    >>> test_data = dedent("""
    ...     [vhosts]
    ...     use_https: true
    ...     """)
    >>> config.push('test', test_data)
    >>> re.search(
    ...     r'^https://localhost:58000/\d+/text.txt$', alias.getURL()
    ...     ) is not None
    True

However, we can force the use of HTTP by setting the 'HTTP_X_SCHEME'
header in the request to 'http', even when 'use_https' is True.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.webapp.servers import LaunchpadTestRequest
    >>> from zope.component import getMultiAdapter
    >>> from urlparse import urlparse
    >>> request = LaunchpadTestRequest(
    ...     environ={'REQUEST_METHOD': 'GET',
    ...              'HTTP_X_SCHEME' : 'http' })
    >>> view = getMultiAdapter((alias,request), name='+index')
    >>> view.initialize()
    >>> print urlparse(request.response.getHeader('Location'))[0]
    http

When the incoming scheme is 'https' then the redirect scheme is
unaffected.

    >>> request = LaunchpadTestRequest(
    ...     environ={'REQUEST_METHOD': 'GET',
    ...              'HTTP_X_SCHEME' : 'https' })
    >>> view = getMultiAdapter((alias,request), name='+index')
    >>> view.initialize()
    >>> print urlparse(request.response.getHeader('Location'))[0]
    https

Reset 'use_https' to its original state.

    >>> test_config_data = config.pop('test')

However, we can't access its contents until we have committed

    >>> alias.open()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        [...]
    LookupError: ...

Once we commit the transaction, LibraryFileAliases can be accessed like
files.

    >>> import transaction
    >>> transaction.commit()

    >>> alias.open()
    >>> alias.read()
    'This is some data'
    >>> alias.close()

We can also read it in chunks.

    >>> alias.open()
    >>> alias.read(2)
    'Th'
    >>> alias.read(6)
    'is is '
    >>> alias.read()
    'some data'
    >>> alias.close()

If you don't want to read the file in chunks you can neglect to call
open() and close().

    >>> alias.read()
    'This is some data'

Each alias also has an expiry date associated with it, the default of None
meaning the file will expire a few days after nothing references it any
more:

    >>> alias.expires is None
    True


== Low Level ==

We can also use the ILibrarianClient Utility directly to store and access
files in the Librarian.

    >>> from canonical.librarian.interfaces import ILibrarianClient
    >>> client = getUtility(ILibrarianClient)
    >>> aid = client.addFile(
    ...     'text.txt', len(data), StringIO(data), 'text/plain', NEVER_EXPIRES
    ...     )
    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> f = client.getFileByAlias(aid)
    >>> f.read()
    'This is some data'
    >>> url = client.getURLForAlias(aid)
    >>> re.search(r'^http://localhost:58000/\d+/text.txt$', url) is not None
    True

At this level we can also reverse the transactional semantics by using the
remoteAddFile instead of the addFile method. In this case, the database
rows are added by the Librarian, which means that the file is downloadable
immediately and will exist even if the client transaction rolls back.
However, the records in the database will not be visible to the client
until it begins a new transaction.

    >>> url = client.remoteAddFile(
    ...     'text.txt', len(data), StringIO(data), 'text/plain'
    ...     )
    >>> print url
    http://localhost:58000/.../text.txt
    >>> from urllib2 import urlopen
    >>> urlopen(url).read()
    'This is some data'

If we abort the transaction, it is still in there

    >>> transaction.abort()
    >>> urlopen(url).read()
    'This is some data'

You can also set the expiry date on the file this way too:

    >>> from datetime import datetime
    >>> from pytz import utc
    >>> url = client.remoteAddFile(
    ...     'text.txt', len(data), StringIO(data), 'text/plain',
    ...     expires=datetime(2005,9,1,12,0,0, tzinfo=utc)
    ...     )
    >>> transaction.abort()

To check the expiry is set, we need to extract the alias id from the URL.
remoteAddFile deliberatly returns the URL instead of the alias id because,
except for test cases, the URL is the only thing useful (because the
client can't see the database records yet).

    >>> import re
    >>> match = re.search('^http://localhost:\d+/(\d+)/', url)
    >>> alias_id = int(match.group(1))
    >>> alias = lfas[alias_id]
    >>> print alias.expires.isoformat()
    2005-09-01T12:00:00+00:00


== Restricted Librarian ==

Some files should not be generally available publicly. If you know the
URL, any file can be retrieved directly from the librarian. For this
reason, there is a restricted librarian to which access is restricted
(at the system-level). This means that only Launchpad has direct access
to the host. You use the IRestrictedLibrarianClient to access this
librarian.

    >>> from zope.interface.verify import verifyObject
    >>> from canonical.librarian.interfaces import IRestrictedLibrarianClient
    >>> restricted_client = getUtility(IRestrictedLibrarianClient)
    >>> verifyObject(IRestrictedLibrarianClient, restricted_client)
    True

File alias uploaded through the restricted librarian have the restricted
attribute set.

    >>> private_content = 'This is private data.'
    >>> private_file_id = restricted_client.addFile(
    ...     'private.txt', len(private_content), StringIO(private_content),
    ...     'text/plain')
    >>> file_alias = getUtility(ILibraryFileAliasSet)[private_file_id]
    >>> file_alias.restricted
    True

    >>> print file_alias.http_url
    http://localhost:58005/.../private.txt

    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> file_alias.open()
    >>> print file_alias.read()
    This is private data.
    >>> file_alias.close()

If you try to retrieve this file through the standard ILibrarianClient,
you'll get a DownloadFailed error.

    >>> client.getFileByAlias(private_file_id)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    DownloadFailed: Alias ... cannot be downloaded from this client.

    >>> client.getURLForAlias(private_file_id)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    DownloadFailed: Alias ... cannot be downloaded from this client.

But using the restricted librarian will work:

    >>> restricted_client.getFileByAlias(private_file_id)
    <canonical.librarian.client._File...>

    >>> file_url = restricted_client.getURLForAlias(private_file_id)
    >>> print file_url
    http://localhost:58005/.../private.txt

Trying to access that file directly on the normal librarian will fail
(by switching the port)

    >>> sneaky_url = file_url.replace(
    ...     config.librarian.restricted_download_url,
    ...     config.librarian.download_url)
    >>> urlopen(sneaky_url).read()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    HTTPError: HTTP Error 404: Not Found

But downloading it from the restricted host, will work.

    >>> print urlopen(file_url).read()
    This is private data.

Trying to retrieve a non-restricted file from the restricted librarian
also fails:

    >>> public_content = 'This is public data.'
    >>> public_file_id = getUtility(ILibrarianClient).addFile(
    ...     'public.txt', len(public_content), StringIO(public_content),
    ...     'text/plain')
    >>> file_alias = getUtility(ILibraryFileAliasSet)[public_file_id]
    >>> file_alias.restricted
    False
    >>> transaction.commit()

    >>> restricted_client.getURLForAlias(public_file_id)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    DownloadFailed: ...

    >>> restricted_client.getFileByAlias(public_file_id)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    DownloadFailed: ...

The remoteAddFile() on the restricted client, also creates a restricted
file:

    >>> url = restricted_client.remoteAddFile(
    ...     'another-private.txt', len(private_content),
    ...     StringIO(private_content), 'text/plain')
    >>> print url
    http://localhost:58005/.../another-private.txt

The file can then immediately be retrieved:

    >>> print urlopen(url).read()
    This is private data.

Another way to create a restricted file is by using the restricted
parameter to ILibraryFileAliasSet:

    >>> restricted_file = getUtility(ILibraryFileAliasSet).create(
    ...     'yet-another-private.txt', len(private_content),
    ...     StringIO(private_content), 'text/plain', restricted=True)
    >>> restricted_file.restricted
    True

Even if one has the SHA1 of the file, searching the librarian for it
will only return the file if it was in the same restriction space.

So searching for the private content on the public librarian will fail:

    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> search_query = "search?digest=%s" % restricted_file.content.sha1
    >>> print urlopen(config.librarian.download_url + search_query).read()
    0

But on the restricted server, this will work:

    >>> result = urlopen(
    ...     config.librarian.restricted_download_url + search_query).read()
    >>> result = result.splitlines()
    >>> print result[0]
    3
    >>> sorted(result[1:])
    ['.../private.txt',
     '.../another-private.txt',
     '.../yet-another-private.txt']


== Odds and Sods ==

An UploadFailed will be raised if you try to create a file with no content

    >>> client.addFile('test.txt', 0, StringIO('hello'), 'text/plain')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        [...]
    UploadFailed: Invalid length: 0

An AssertionError will be raised if the number of bytes that could be read
from the file don't match the declared size.

    >>> client.addFile('test.txt', 42, StringIO(''), 'text/plain')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        [...]
    AssertionError: size is 42, but 0 were read from the file

Filenames with spaces in them work.

    >>> aid = client.addFile('hot dog', len(data), StringIO(data), 'text/plain')
    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> f = client.getFileByAlias(aid)
    >>> f.read()
    'This is some data'
    >>> url = client.getURLForAlias(aid)
    >>> re.search(r'^http://localhost:58000/\d+/hot%20dog$', url) is not None
    True

Unicode file names work.  Note that the filename in the resulting URL
is encoded as UTF-8.

    >>> aid = client.addFile(u'Yow\N{INTERROBANG}', len(data), StringIO(data),
    ...                      'text/plain')
    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> f = client.getFileByAlias(aid)
    >>> f.read()
    'This is some data'
    >>> url = client.getURLForAlias(aid)
    >>> re.search(r'^http://localhost:58000/\d+/Yow%E2%80%BD$', url) is not None
    True

Files will get garbage collected on production systems as per
LibrarianGarbageCollection. If you request the URL of a deleted file, you
will be given None

    >>> alias = lfas[36]
    >>> alias.content.deleted
    True
    >>> alias.http_url is None
    True
    >>> alias.https_url is None
    True
    >>> alias.getURL() is None
    True
    >>> client.getURLForAlias(alias.id) is None
    True


== Default View ==

A librarian file has a default view that should redirect to the download URL.

    >>> from zope.component import getMultiAdapter
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.webapp.servers import LaunchpadTestRequest
    >>> req = LaunchpadTestRequest()
    >>> alias = lfas.create(
    ...     'text2.txt', len(data), StringIO(data), 'text/plain', NEVER_EXPIRES
    ...     )
    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> lfa_view = getMultiAdapter((alias,req), name='+index')
    >>> lfa_view.initialize()
    >>> lfa_url = lfa_view.context.getURL()
    >>> url = alias.getURL()
    >>> lfa_url == url
    True
