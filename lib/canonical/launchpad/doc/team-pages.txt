On a team home page, we show up to the latest five members who were approved
as well as the up to five latest members who proposed themselves.

    >>> ubuntu_team = person_set.getByName('name18')
    >>> team_home = create_view(ubuntu_team, '+index')
    >>> membershipset = getUtility(ITeamMembershipSet)
    >>> for member in team_home.recently_approved_members:
    ...     membership = membershipset.getByPersonAndTeam(member, ubuntu_team)
    ...     print "%s: %s" % (member.name, membership.status.title)
    name20: Approved
    spiv: Approved
    limi: Approved

    >>> for member in team_home.recently_proposed_members:
    ...     membership = membershipset.getByPersonAndTeam(member, ubuntu_team)
    ...     print "%s: %s" % (member.name, membership.status.title)

If new members are added/proposed, they'll show up at the top of the lists.

    >>> sample_person = person_set.getByName('name12')
    >>> login_person(sample_person)
    >>> sample_person.join(ubuntu_team)
    >>> salgado = person_set.getByName('salgado')
    >>> sabdfl = person_set.getByName('sabdfl')
    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')
    >>> ubuntu_team.addMember(salgado, reviewer=sabdfl)

    >>> team_home = create_view(ubuntu_team, '+index')
    >>> for member in team_home.recently_approved_members:
    ...     membership = membershipset.getByPersonAndTeam(member, ubuntu_team)
    ...     print "%s: %s" % (member.name, membership.status.title)
    salgado: Approved
    name20: Approved
    spiv: Approved
    limi: Approved

    >>> for member in team_home.recently_proposed_members:

Posting malformed data to the team home page raises an error.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.webapp.servers import LaunchpadTestRequest
    >>> broken_request = LaunchpadTestRequest(
    ...     form={})
    >>> broken_request.method = 'POST'
    >>> team_home = getMultiAdapter(
    ...     (ubuntu_team, broken_request), name='+index')
    >>> team_home.initialize()
    Traceback (most recent call last):

    UnexpectedFormData: The mailing list form did not receive the expected
    form fields.


== +map-portlet ==

The team profile page contain the location portlet that shows a map. The
map requires the google GMap JavaScript to display, so the views set the
state of the request's needs_gmap2 attribute to true if there are
members who have set their location.

    >>> team_view = create_initialized_view(ubuntu_team, '+index')
    >>> team_view.has_visible_location
    False
    >>> team_view.request.needs_gmap2
    False

After a member has set his location, the map will be rendered.

    >>> from zope.security.proxy import removeSecurityProxy

    >>> def clear_location_caches(context):
    ...     naked_context = removeSecurityProxy(context)
    ...     if '_mapped_participants_count_cache' in naked_context.__dict__:
    ...         del naked_context._mapped_participants_count_cache
    ...     if '_mapped_participants_cache' in naked_context.__dict__:
    ...         del naked_context._mapped_participants_cache

    >>> login_person(sample_person)
    >>> sample_person.setLocation(
    ...     38.81, 77.1, 'America/New_York', sample_person)
    >>> clear_location_caches(ubuntu_team)

    >>> team_view = create_initialized_view(ubuntu_team, '+index')
    >>> team_view.has_visible_location
    True
    >>> team_view.request.needs_gmap2
    True

The small_maps key in the launchpad_views cookie can be set by the viewing
user to 'false' to indicate that small maps are not wanted.

    >>> cookie = 'launchpad_views=small_maps=false'
    >>> team_view = create_initialized_view(
    ...     ubuntu_team, '+index', cookie=cookie)
    >>> team_view.request.needs_gmap2
    False


== +map ==

A team's +map page will show a map with markers on the location of all
members of that team.  That page also lists the local times of members.

    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')
    >>> context = factory.makeTeam(salgado)
    >>> len(context.mapped_participants)
    0
    >>> view = create_initialized_view(context, '+map')
    >>> view.times
    []

There are no mapped member yet, so needs_gmap2 is False, so the map will
not be rendered.

    >>> view.request.needs_gmap2
    False

Once a member is mapped, needs_gmap2 is True and the map will be rendered.
The number of times is incremented for each timezone added.

    >>> london_member = factory.makePerson(
    ...     latitude=51.49, longitude=-0.13, time_zone='Europe/London')
    >>> context.addMember(london_member, sabdfl)
    >>> clear_location_caches(context)
    >>> len(context.mapped_participants)
    1
    >>> view = create_initialized_view(context, '+map')
    >>> len(view.times)
    1

    >>> view.request.needs_gmap2
    True

    >>> brazil_member = factory.makePerson(
    ...     latitude=-23.60, longitude=-46.64, time_zone='America/Sao_Paulo')
    >>> context.addMember(brazil_member, sabdfl)
    >>> clear_location_caches(context)
    >>> len(context.mapped_participants)
    2
    >>> view = create_initialized_view(context, '+map')
    >>> len(view.times)
    2

If we had two members in London, though, we wouldn't list London's time
twice, for obvious reasons.

    >>> london_member2 = factory.makePerson(
    ...     latitude=51.49, longitude=-0.13, time_zone='Europe/London')
    >>> context.addMember(london_member2, sabdfl)
    >>> clear_location_caches(context)
    >>> len(context.mapped_participants)
    3
    >>> view = create_view(context, '+map')
    >>> len(view.times)
    2

The template can ask if the team has mapped members, so that it does not
need to work with counts or the list of members.

    >>> view.has_mapped_participants
    True

The cached bounds of the mapped members of the team can be used to define
the scale of a map.

    >>> bounds = view.bounds
    >>> for key in sorted(bounds):
    ...     print "%s: %s" % (key, bounds[key])
    center_lat: 13...
    center_lng: -23...
    max_lat: 51...
    max_lng: -0...
    min_lat: -23...
    min_lng: -46...


== Contacting the team ==

Logged in users can contact any other Launchpad user through a 'Contact this
user' feature (see person-pages.txt).  Similarly, a logged in user can contact
a team through a 'Contact this team' link.

The team's overview page tells us that we're contacting a team instead of a
user. The title of the link states that the team owner will be contacted
because bart is not a member of the team.

    >>> guadamen = person_set.getByName('guadamen')
    >>> bart = factory.makePerson(email='bart@example.com', name='bart')
    >>> login_person(bart)

    >>> view = create_initialized_view(guadamen, '+index')
    >>> print view.contact_link_title
    Send an email to this team's owner through Launchpad
    >>> print view.specific_contact_text
    Contact this team
