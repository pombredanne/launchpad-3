= Launchpad Answer Tracker =

Launchpad includes an Answer Tracker where users can post questions
(usually about problems they encounter with projects) and other can
answer them.) Questions are created and accessed using the
IQuestionTarget interface. This interface is available on Products,
Distributions and DistributionSourcePackages.

    >>> login('test@canonical.com')

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.webapp.testing import verifyObject
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import (
    ...     IDistributionSet, IProductSet, IPersonSet, IQuestionTarget)

    >>> firefox = getUtility(IProductSet)['firefox']
    >>> verifyObject(IQuestionTarget, firefox)
    True

    >>> ubuntu = getUtility(IDistributionSet).getByName('ubuntu')
    >>> verifyObject(IQuestionTarget, ubuntu)
    True

    >>> evolution_in_ubuntu = ubuntu.getSourcePackage('evolution')
    >>> verifyObject(IQuestionTarget, evolution_in_ubuntu)
    True

Although Distribution series do not implement the IQuestionTarget
interface, it is possible to adapt one to it. (The adapter is actually
the distroseries's distribution.)

    >>> ubuntu_warty = ubuntu.getSeries('warty')
    >>> IQuestionTarget.providedBy(ubuntu_warty)
    False
    >>> questiontarget = IQuestionTarget(ubuntu_warty)
    >>> verifyObject(IQuestionTarget, questiontarget)
    True

Similarly, it is possible to adapt an ISourcePackageRelease into an
IQuestionTarget.

    >>> firefox_in_warty = ubuntu_warty.getSourcePackage('mozilla-firefox')
    >>> firefox_release_in_warty = firefox_in_warty.currentrelease

    >>> questiontarget = IQuestionTarget(firefox_release_in_warty)
    >>> verifyObject(IQuestionTarget, questiontarget)
    True

SourcePackages are also QuestionTargets.
XXX sinzui 2007-04-24. #108240 SourcePackages should not be QuestionTargets

    >>> evolution_in_hoary = ubuntu.currentseries.getSourcePackage('evolution')
    >>> questiontarget = IQuestionTarget(evolution_in_hoary)
    >>> verifyObject(IQuestionTarget, questiontarget)
    True

You create a new question by calling the newQuestion() method of an
IQuestionTarget attribute.

    >>> sample_person = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByEmail('test@canonical.com')
    >>> firefox_question = firefox.newQuestion(
    ...     sample_person, "Firefox question", "Unable to use Firefox")

(The complete IQuestionTarget interface is documented in
../interfaces/ftests/questiontarget.txt.)

== Official usage ==

A product or distribution may be offically supported by the community
using the Answer Tracker. This status is set by the official_answers
attribute on the IProduct and IDistribution.

    >>> ubuntu.official_answers
    True
    >>> firefox.official_answers
    True

== IQuestion ==

Questions are manipulated through the IQuestion interface:

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IQuestion
    >>> from zope.security.proxy import removeSecurityProxy

    # The complete interface is not necessarily available to the
    # logged in user.
    >>> verifyObject(IQuestion, removeSecurityProxy(firefox_question))
    True

The person who submitted the question is available in the owner field.

    >>> firefox_question.owner == sample_person
    True

When the question is created, the owner is added to the question's
subscribers:

    >>> sample_person in [s.person for s in firefox_question.subscriptions]
    True

The question status is 'Open':

    >>> firefox_question.status.title
    'Open'

And the creation time is recorded in the datecreated attribute:

    >>> from datetime import datetime, timedelta
    >>> from pytz import UTC
    >>> now = datetime.now(UTC)
    >>> now - firefox_question.datecreated < timedelta(seconds=5)
    True

The target onto which the question was created is available through the
'target' attribute:

    >>> firefox_question.target == firefox
    True

It is also possible to adapt a question to its IQuestionTarget.

    >>> target = IQuestionTarget(firefox_question)
    >>> verifyObject(IQuestionTarget, target)
    True

The question can be assigned to a new IQuestionTarget.

    >>> thunderbird = getUtility(IProductSet)['thunderbird']
    >>> firefox_question.target = thunderbird
    >>> print firefox_question.target.displayname
    Mozilla Thunderbird

When a question is reassigned, its product, distribution and
sourcepackagename attributes are reconciled with the IQuestionTarget.

    >>> firefox_question.target = ubuntu
    >>> print firefox_question.target.displayname
    Ubuntu
    >>> print firefox_question.distribution.name
    ubuntu
    >>> print firefox_question.sourcepackagename
    None
    >>> print firefox_question.product
    None

    >>> firefox_question.target = evolution_in_ubuntu
    >>> print firefox_question.target.displayname
    evolution in ubuntu
    >>> print firefox_question.distribution.name
    ubuntu
    >>> print firefox_question.sourcepackagename.name
    evolution
    >>> print firefox_question.product
    None

    >>> firefox_question.target = firefox
    >>> print firefox_question.target.displayname
    Mozilla Firefox
    >>> print firefox_question.distribution
    None
    >>> print firefox_question.sourcepackagename
    None
    >>> print firefox_question.product.name
    firefox


== Subscriptions and Notifications ==

Whenever a question is created or changed, email notifications will be
sent. To receive such notification, one can subscribe to the bug using
the subscribe() method.

    >>> no_priv = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('no-priv')
    >>> subscription = firefox_question.subscribe(no_priv)

The list of subscriptions is available in the subscriptions attribute.
In the current case, the subscribers will include the owner
('Sample Person') and the newly subscribed person.

    >>> [s.person.displayname for s in firefox_question.subscriptions]
    [u'Sample Person', u'No Privileges Person']

To remove a person from the subscriptions list, we use the unsubscribe()
method.

    >>> firefox_question.unsubscribe(no_priv)
    >>> [s.person.displayname for s in firefox_question.subscriptions]
    [u'Sample Person']

The persons who are on the subscription list are said to be directly
subscribed to the question. They explicitly choose to get notifications
about that particular question. This list of persons is available through
the getDirectSubscribers() method.

    >>> subscribers = firefox_question.getDirectSubscribers()

That method returns an INotificationRecipientSet, containing the direct
subscribers along the rationale for contacting them:

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import INotificationRecipientSet
    >>> verifyObject(INotificationRecipientSet, subscribers)
    True
    >>> [person.displayname for person in subscribers]
    [u'Sample Person']
    >>> subscribers.getReason(sample_person)
    ('You received this question notification because you are a direct
      subscriber of the question.', 'Subscriber')

There is also a list of 'indirect' subscribers to the question. These
are persons that didn't explicitly subscribed to the question, but that
will receive notifications for other reason. Answer contacts for the
question target are part of the indirect subscribers list.

    # There are no answer contacts on the firefox product.
    >>> [person.displayname
    ...     for person in firefox_question.getIndirectSubscribers()]
    []
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import ILanguageSet
    >>> english = getUtility(ILanguageSet)['en']
    >>> no_priv.addLanguage(english)
    >>> firefox.addAnswerContact(no_priv)
    True

    >>> indirect_subscribers = firefox_question.getIndirectSubscribers()
    >>> verifyObject(INotificationRecipientSet, indirect_subscribers)
    True
    >>> [person.displayname for person in indirect_subscribers]
    [u'No Privileges Person']
    >>> indirect_subscribers.getReason(no_priv)
    (u'You received this question notification because you are an answer
      contact for Mozilla Firefox.',
     u'Answer Contact (Mozilla Firefox)')

There is a special case for when the question's is associated to a
source package. The answer contacts for both the distribution and the
source package are part of the indirect subscribers list.

    # Let's register some answer contacts for the distribution and
    # the package.
    >>> list(ubuntu.answer_contacts)
    []
    >>> list(evolution_in_ubuntu.answer_contacts)
    []
    >>> ubuntu_team = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('ubuntu-team')
    >>> ubuntu_team.addLanguage(english)
    >>> ubuntu.addAnswerContact(ubuntu_team)
    True
    >>> evolution_in_ubuntu.addAnswerContact(no_priv)
    True
    >>> package_question = evolution_in_ubuntu.newQuestion(
    ...     sample_person, 'Upgrading to Evolution 1.4 breaks plug-ins',
    ...     "The FnordsHighlighter plug-in doesn't work after upgrade.")
    >>> [s.person.displayname for s in package_question.subscriptions]
    [u'Sample Person']
    >>> indirect_subscribers = package_question.getIndirectSubscribers()
    >>> [person.displayname for person in indirect_subscribers]
    [u'No Privileges Person', u'Ubuntu Team']
    >>> indirect_subscribers.getReason(ubuntu_team)
    (u'You received this question notification because you are a member of
      Ubuntu Team, which is an answer contact for Ubuntu.',
     u'Answer Contact (ubuntu) @ubuntu-team')
    >>> indirect_subscribers.getReason(no_priv)
    (u'You received this question notification because you are an answer
      contact for evolution in ubuntu.',
     u'Answer Contact (evolution in ubuntu)')

The question's assignee is also part of the indirect subscription list:

    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')
    >>> package_question.assignee = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('name16')
    >>> indirect_subscribers = package_question.getIndirectSubscribers()
    >>> [person.displayname for person in indirect_subscribers]
    [u'Foo Bar', u'No Privileges Person', u'Ubuntu Team']
    >>> indirect_subscribers.getReason(package_question.assignee)
    ('You received this question notification because you are the assignee
      for this question.',
     'Assignee')

Notifications are sent to the list of direct and indirect subscribers.
The notification recipients list can be obtained by using the
getSubscribers() method.

    >>> login('no-priv@canonical.com')
    >>> subscribers = firefox_question.getSubscribers()
    >>> verifyObject(INotificationRecipientSet, subscribers)
    True
    >>> [person.displayname for person in subscribers]
    [u'No Privileges Person', u'Sample Person']

(More documentation on the question notifications can be found in
'answer-tracker-notifications.txt'.)

== Workflow ==

A question status should not be manipulated directly but through the
workflow methods.

The complete question workflow is documented in
'answer-tracker-workflow.txt'.

== Bug Linking ==

Question implements the IBugLinkTarget interface which makes it possible
to link bug report to question.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IBugLinkTarget
    >>> verifyObject(IBugLinkTarget, firefox_question)
    True

(See ../interfaces/ftests/buglinktarget.txt for the documentation and
test of the IBugLinkTarget interface.)

When a bug is linked to a question, the question's owner is subscribed to
the bug.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IBugSet
    >>> bug7 = getUtility(IBugSet).get(7)
    >>> bug7.isSubscribed(firefox_question.owner)
    False
    >>> firefox_question.linkBug(bug7)
    <QuestionBug...>
    >>> bug7.isSubscribed(firefox_question.owner)
    True

When the link is removed, the owner is unsubscribed:

    >>> firefox_question.unlinkBug(bug7)
    <QuestionBug...>
    >>> bug7.isSubscribed(firefox_question.owner)
    False

== Unsupported Questions ==

While a Person may ask questions in his language of choice, that does
not mean that indirect subscribers (Answer Contacts) to an
IQuestionTarget speak that language. IQuestionTarget can return a list
Questions in languages that are not supported

    >>> unsupported_questions = firefox.searchQuestions(unsupported=True)
    >>> sorted([question.title for question in unsupported_questions])
    [u'Problemas de Impress\xe3o no Firefox']

    >>> unsupported_questions = evolution_in_ubuntu.searchQuestions(
    ...     unsupported=True)
    >>> sorted([question.title for question in unsupported_questions])
    []

    >>> warty_question_target = IQuestionTarget(ubuntu_warty)
    >>> unsupported_questions = warty_question_target.searchQuestions(
    ...     unsupported=True)
    >>> sorted([question.title for question in unsupported_questions])
    [u'Problema al recompilar kernel con soporte smp (doble-n\xfacleo)',
     u'\u0639\u0643\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u063a\u064a\u064a\u0631...]
