All mails sent to Launchpad can be accessed with the IMailBox utility.
There are two different IMailBox utilities available. One, TestMailBox,
is configured for tests, and operates on stub.test_emails. This means
that every mail you send in a test can be accessed by using this mail
box.

There's also an IMailBox which interfaces with a POP3 server. It can be
configured in ZCML with:

    <mail:pop3MailBox host="somehost" user="someuser" password="secret" />

It also supports POP3 over ssl:

    <mail:pop3MailBox
        host="somehost" user="someuser" password="secret" ssl="true" />

Let's look at the one we use in tests:

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IMailBox
    >>> mailbox = getUtility(IMailBox)

Now it's empty, so let's add some mails to it by using simple_sendmail:

    >>> import transaction
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.mail import simple_sendmail
    >>> msgid = simple_sendmail('test@canonical.com',
    ...                         '123@bugs.canonical.com', 
    ...                         'Hello',
    ...                         'bla bla bla',
    ...                         headers={'Message-ID': '<test1>'})
    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> msgid = simple_sendmail('test@canonical.com',
    ...                         '456@bugs.canonical.com', 
    ...                         'Hello',
    ...                         'bla bla bla',
    ...                         headers={'Message-ID': '<test2>'})
    >>> transaction.commit()

Before we can use it, it has to be opened.

    >>> mailbox.open()

To prevent two threads opening it the same time, if it's already open,
we can't open it again:

    >>> mailbox.open()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    MailBoxError: The mail box is already open.

There's only one mail in the mail box, and it's the same as we sent
before:

    >>> mails = list(mailbox.items())
    >>> len(mails)
    2 
    >>> id, raw_mail = mails[0]
    >>> import email
    >>> mail = email.message_from_string(raw_mail)
    >>> print mail['Message-ID']
    <test1>

When we're done using the mail box we have to close it:

    >>> mailbox.close()

Since we didn't delete the mail, it's still in there:

    >>> mailbox.open()
    >>> mails = list(mailbox.items())
    >>> len(mails)
    2 
    >>> id, raw_mail = mails[0]
    >>> mail = email.message_from_string(raw_mail)
    >>> print mail['Message-ID']
    <test1>

Let's delete all mails in the mail box:

    >>> for id, mail in mailbox.items():
    ...     mailbox.delete(id)
    >>> list(mailbox.items())
    []

If we try to delete a mail that doesn't exist we get an error:

    >>> mailbox.delete(-1)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    MailBoxError: No such id: -1

    >>> mailbox.close()
