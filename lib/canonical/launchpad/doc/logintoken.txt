LoginToken
==========

This is the mechanism we use whenever we need to confirm a person has access
to the emails sent to a given email address. The process works as follows:
    
    1) User tries to do something in Launchpad that requires the confirmation
       of an email address.

    2) We send a message with a link containing a one-time randomly generated
       token and instructions on how to finish the confirmation process.

    3) User follows the link sent by email and provide any extra information
       needed, which varies according to the LoginToken's type and submits the
       page form.

    4) The token is now marked as consumed, together with any other tokens of
       the same type and for the same email address.


    >>> from canonical.launchpad.database.person import Person
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.database.logintoken import LoginTokenSet
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import LoginTokenType
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.mail import stub
    >>> from canonical.database.sqlbase import flush_database_updates
    >>> import transaction
    >>> foobar = Person.byName('name16')

Let's create a new LoginToken to confirm an email address for foobar.

    >>> token = LoginTokenSet().new(
    ...     foobar, 'foo.bar@canonical.com', 'foo.bar2@canonical.com',
    ...     LoginTokenType.VALIDATEEMAIL)
    >>> token.sendEmailValidationRequest('http://localhost:9000')
    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> from_addr, to_addrs, raw_msg = stub.test_emails.pop()
    >>> to_addrs
    ['foo.bar2@canonical.com']

As the process is not yet finished, foobar will see this as one of his
unconfirmed email addresses.

    >>> flush_database_updates()
    >>> foobar.unvalidatedemails
    [u'foo.bar2@canonical.com']

It's possible to create another token for the same purpose, but this won't
cause that email to show up twice on foobar's list of unconfirmed emails.

    >>> token2 = LoginTokenSet().new(
    ...     foobar, 'foo.bar@canonical.com', 'foo.bar2@canonical.com',
    ...     LoginTokenType.VALIDATEEMAIL)
    >>> flush_database_updates()
    >>> foobar.unvalidatedemails
    [u'foo.bar2@canonical.com']

Once foobar finished the process, confirming his new email address, we mark
the token as consumed.

    >>> token.date_consumed is not None
    False
    >>> token.consume()
    >>> token.date_consumed is not None
    True

This will also mark the other token as consumed, as the process is already
finished and thus it can't be used anymore.
    
    >>> token2.date_consumed is not None
    True

Now that the token was consumed, that new email won't show up on foobar's list
of unconfirmed emails anymore.

    >>> flush_database_updates()
    >>> foobar.unvalidatedemails
    []
