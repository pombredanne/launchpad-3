= Finding Similar Bugs =

The normal bug search requires all the specified keywords to be present
in the found bugs. This works quite well in general, but not when you
want to find bugs similar to a given bug summary when filing a new bug;
then the search is too restrictive.

To address this use case, IBugTask.findSimilar can be used, which uses
nl_phrase_search in order to construct a suitable search string.

It doesn't make much sense to find bugs similar to an empty string, so
no results will be returned.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import (
    ...     IBugTaskSet, IPersonSet, IProductSet)
    >>> firefox = getUtility(IProductSet).getByName('firefox')
    >>> sample_person = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByEmail('test@canonical.com')
    >>> similar_bugs = getUtility(IBugTaskSet).findSimilar(
    ...     sample_person, '', product=firefox)
    >>> similar_bugs.count()
    0

Also, of course, if the given summary isn't similar to any other bugs,
no results are returned.


    >>> similar_bugs = getUtility(IBugTaskSet).findSimilar(
    ...     sample_person, 'nosimilarbugs', product=firefox)
    >>> similar_bugs.count()
    0

Now, let's enter a real bug summary, which doesn't match any other
exactly. We can see that it still manages to find a bug.

    >>> similar_bugs = getUtility(IBugTaskSet).findSimilar(
    ...     sample_person, "Can't display SVG", product=firefox)
    >>> for bugtask in similar_bugs:
    ...     print bugtask.bug.title
    Firefox does not support SVG


Above we specified that only bugs against Firefox should be searched. If
we specify Evolution, no bugs will be returned, since no similar bugs
are found there.

    >>> evolution = getUtility(IProductSet).getByName('evolution')
    >>> similar_bugs = getUtility(IBugTaskSet).findSimilar(
    ...     sample_person, "Can't display SVG", product=evolution)
    >>> similar_bugs.count()
    0

We can also search for distribution bugs:


    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IDistributionSet
    >>> ubuntu = getUtility(IDistributionSet).getByName('ubuntu')
    >>> similar_bugs = getUtility(IBugTaskSet).findSimilar(
    ...     sample_person, "Thunderbird crashes when displaying SVG",
    ...     distribution=ubuntu)
    >>> for bugtask in similar_bugs:
    ...     print bugtask.bug.title
    Thunderbird crashes
    Firefox does not support SVG

As well as limiting it to a specific source package:


    >>> ubuntu_thunderbird = ubuntu.getSourcePackage('thunderbird')
    >>> similar_bugs = getUtility(IBugTaskSet).findSimilar(
    ...     sample_person, "Can't display SVG",
    ...     distribution=ubuntu,
    ...     sourcepackagename=ubuntu_thunderbird.sourcepackagename)
    >>> similar_bugs.count()
    0


== Private bugs ==

Only bugs that the user has access to view will be searched. If we set
the Firefox bug to private, and repeat the search as a user who isn't
allowed to view it, only the Thunderbird bug will be returned this time.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IBugSet
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests import syncUpdate
    >>> login('test@canonical.com')
    >>> firefox_svg_bug = getUtility(IBugSet).get(1)
    >>> firefox_svg_bug.private = True
    >>> syncUpdate(firefox_svg_bug)

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.webapp.authorization import check_permission
    >>> login('no-priv@canonical.com')
    >>> check_permission('launchpad.View', firefox_svg_bug)
    False
    >>> no_priv = getUtility(ILaunchBag).user
    >>> similar_bugs = getUtility(IBugTaskSet).findSimilar(
    ...     no_priv, "Thunderbird chrashes when displaying SVG",
    ...     distribution=ubuntu)
    >>> for bugtask in similar_bugs:
    ...     print bugtask.bug.title
    Thunderbird crashes

    >>> login('test@canonical.com')
    >>> firefox_svg_bug.private = False
    >>> syncUpdate(firefox_svg_bug)


== Ordering of search results ==

Since the search uses OR to match bugs against the entered phrase, many
bugs will be returned by a search. Since we usually want to display on
a few number of bugs to the user, it's important that the results are
ordered in a way that the bugs matching the phrase best are first in the
list.

When searching for similar bugs, the results are ordered by ranking the
results of the fulltext search on the Bug table, so bugs that have a
summary or description that match the phrase will be displayed first.

    >>> similar_bugs = getUtility(IBugTaskSet).findSimilar(
    ...     sample_person, "Another test bug for Thunderbird",
    ...     distribution=ubuntu)
    >>> for bugtask in similar_bugs:
    ...     print bugtask.bug.title
    another test bug
    Thunderbird crashes

    >>> similar_bugs = getUtility(IBugTaskSet).findSimilar(
    ...     sample_person, "Another Thunderbird crash",
    ...     distribution=ubuntu)
    >>> for bugtask in similar_bugs:
    ...     print bugtask.bug.title
    Thunderbird crashes
    another test bug
