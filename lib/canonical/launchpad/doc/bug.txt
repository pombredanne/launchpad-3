Bugs in Malone
==============

This document describes what a Bug is in Malone, and provides some (currently
rather incomplete) info on how to poke at bugs through the Component
Architecture.

Working with Bugs
-----------------

Bugs are created and retrieved via IBugSet.

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IBugSet
    >>> bugset = getUtility(IBugSet)

To retrieve a specific Bug, use IBugSet.get:

    >>> firefox_crashes = bugset.get(6)
    >>> print firefox_crashes.title
    Firefox crashes when Save As dialog for a nonexistent window is closed

If the bug can't be found, a zope.exceptions.NotFoundError will be
raised:

    >>> bugset.get(123456)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    NotFoundError: 'Unable to locate bug with ID 123456'

Searching for Bugs
------------------

To search for bugs matching specific criteria, use IBugSet.searchAsUser:

    >>> from canonical.database.sqlbase import flush_database_updates
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import ILaunchBag

    >>> login("foo.bar@canonical.com")

    >>> firefox_test_bug = bugset.get(3)
    >>> firefox_test_bug.duplicateof = firefox_crashes.id
    >>> flush_database_updates()

    >>> dups_of_bug_six = bugset.searchAsUser(
    ...     duplicateof=firefox_crashes, user=getUtility(ILaunchBag).user)
    >>> print dups_of_bug_six.count()
    1
    >>> dups_of_bug_six[0].id
    3

    >>> firefox_test_bug.duplicateof = None
    >>> flush_database_updates()
    >>> dups_of_bug_six = bugset.searchAsUser(
    ...     duplicateof=firefox_crashes, user=getUtility(ILaunchBag).user)
    >>> print dups_of_bug_six.count()
    0

    >>> login(ANONYMOUS)

Absolute URLs
-------------

For things like bug notification emails, it's handy to be able to
include a URL to the bug inside the email.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.webapp import canonical_url
    >>> print canonical_url(firefox_crashes)
    http://.../malone/bugs/6

Bug Privacy
===========

A Bug has a "private" field. If Bug.private is False, the bug is publicly
visible. If Bug.private is True, only people who are explicitly subscribed to
the bug can see it. Launchpad admins can always view and modify private bugs.

Marking Bugs Private
--------------------

For the purposes of demonstration, we'll make the firefox crashing bug
private. A bug cannot be made private by an anonymous user.

    >>> firefox_crashes.private = True
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    Unauthorized: ('private', 'launchpad.Edit')

We have to be logged in, so let's do that:

    >>> login("test@canonical.com")

Now we can toggle the privacy flag on a bug, but before we do, let's note what
happens to subscriptions on a bug before and after it's marked private. So,
there are currently no explicit subscripitions to this bug.

    >>> print firefox_crashes.subscriptions
    []

The maintainer is "implicitly" subscribed to the bug. However, the rule with
private bugs is that only explicit subscribers can view the bug after it's been
marked private. So, when we mark bug #6 private:

    >>> from zope.event import notify
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.event import (
    ...     SQLObjectModifiedEvent, SQLObjectToBeModifiedEvent,
    ...     SQLObjectCreatedEvent)
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IPersonSet

    >>> new_values = {"private" : True}
    >>> bug_will_be_set_private = SQLObjectToBeModifiedEvent(
    ...     firefox_crashes, new_values)

    >>> notify(bug_will_be_set_private)

    >>> def capture_state(obj, *fields):
    ...     class State: pass
    ...     state = State()
    ...     for field in fields:
    ...         setattr(state, field, getattr(obj, field))
    ...     return state
    >>> old_state = capture_state(
    ...     firefox_crashes, "id", "title", "summary", "description", "name",
    ...     "private", "duplicateof")
    >>> firefox_crashes.private = True
    >>> bug_set_private = SQLObjectModifiedEvent(
    ...     firefox_crashes, old_state,
    ...     ["id", "title", "private"])

    >>> notify(bug_set_private)
    >>> flush_database_updates()

The maintainer is automatically explicitly subscribed.

    >>> people_ids_subscribed = [
    ...     subscription.person.id
    ...     for subscription in list(firefox_crashes.subscriptions)]
    >>> people_ids_subscribed.sort()
    >>> print people_ids_subscribed
    [12]

How Privacy Affects Access to a Bug
-----------------------------------

Once a bug is made private, it can only be accessed by the users that are
explicitly subscribed to the bug and Launchpad admins.

So, remembering that we're still logged in as Sample Person (ID 12 in
the Person table), and that Sample Person is an explicit subscriber to
the firefox_crashes bug, we can still access properties of this bug:

    >>> firefox_crashes.title
    u'Firefox crashes when Save As dialog for a nonexistent window is closed'

Note that a search will return all the bugs, as well:

    >>> all_bugs = bugset.searchAsUser(
    ...     user=getUtility(ILaunchBag).user, orderBy="id")
    >>> [bug.id for bug in all_bugs]
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

Likewise Foo Bar, an admin, can access the bug.

    >>> login("foo.bar@canonical.com")

    >>> old_title = firefox_crashes.title
    >>> firefox_crashes.title = "new title"
    >>> firefox_crashes.title
    u'new title'
    >>> firefox_crashes.title = old_title
    >>> firefox_crashes.title
    u'Firefox crashes when Save As dialog for a nonexistent window is closed'

Bug #6 is returned by the search results for an admin as well:

    >>> all_bugs = bugset.searchAsUser(
    ...     user=getUtility(ILaunchBag).user, orderBy="id")
    >>> [bug.id for bug in all_bugs]
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

As one would expect, the permissions are team aware. So, let's retrieve a bug
and set it private (as Foo Bar again who, of course, is an admin.)

    >>> blackhole_trash_folder = bugset.get(2)

And again, let's fake setting the bug private:

    >>> new_values = {"private" : True}
    >>> bug_will_be_set_private = SQLObjectToBeModifiedEvent(
    ...     blackhole_trash_folder, new_values)

    >>> notify(bug_will_be_set_private)

    >>> old_state = capture_state(
    ...     blackhole_trash_folder, "id", "title", "summary",
    ...     "description", "name", "private", "duplicateof")
    >>> blackhole_trash_folder.private = True
    >>> bug_set_private = SQLObjectModifiedEvent(
    ...     blackhole_trash_folder, old_state,
    ...     ["id", "title", "private"])

    >>> notify(bug_set_private)
    >>> flush_database_updates()

Jeff Waugh, a member of the Ubuntu Team, is able to access this bug:

    >>> login("jeff.waugh@ubuntulinux.com")

    >>> old_title = blackhole_trash_folder.title
    >>> blackhole_trash_folder.title = "new title"
    >>> blackhole_trash_folder.title
    u'new title'
    >>> blackhole_trash_folder.title = old_title
    >>> blackhole_trash_folder.title
    u'Blackhole Trash folder'

and see it (bug #2) in searches:

    >>> all_bugs = bugset.searchAsUser(
    ...     user=getUtility(ILaunchBag).user, orderBy="id")
    >>> [bug.id for bug in all_bugs]
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8]

If we login as someone who *isn't* a member of the Ubuntu Team (and
isn't otherwise someone who should be allowed to access the properties
of this bug) though:

    >>> login("kreutzm@itp.uni-hannover.de")

Trying to access a property of this bug will again raise an
Unauthorized:

    >>> blackhole_trash_folder.title
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    Unauthorized: ('title', 'launchpad.View')

And, as you might have guessed, is once again invisible in searches
(notice that bug #6 is also invisible to Helge):

    >>> all_bugs = bugset.searchAsUser(
    ...     user=getUtility(ILaunchBag).user, orderBy="id")
    >>> [bug.id for bug in all_bugs]
    [1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8]

Filing Public vs. Private Bugs
------------------------------

Let's log back in as Foo Bar to continue our examples:

    >>> login("foo.bar@canonical.com")

When a public bug is filed:

>>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IProductSet
>>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IPersonSet
>>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IBugSet
>>> productset = getUtility(IProductSet)
>>> personset = getUtility(IPersonSet)
>>> bugset = getUtility(IBugSet)

>>> firefox = productset.get(4)
>>> foobar = personset.get(16)
>>> added_bug = getUtility(IBugSet).createBug(
...     product=firefox, title="test firefox bug",
...     comment="blah blah blah", owner=foobar)
>>> notify(SQLObjectCreatedEvent(added_bug))
>>> public_bug = bugset.get(added_bug.id)

the submitter is explicitly subscribed. The maintainer is considered implicitly
subscribed:

>>> print [subscription.person.id for subscription in public_bug.subscriptions]
[16]

The first comment made (this is submitted in the bug report) is set to
the description of the bug:

>>> public_bug.description
u'blah blah blah'

The bug description can also be accessed through the task:

>>> public_bug.bugtasks[0].bug.description
u'blah blah blah'
>>> public_bug.description = 'a new description'
>>> public_bug.bugtasks[0].bug.description
u'a new description'

When a private bug is filed:

>>> added_bug = getUtility(IBugSet).createBug(
...     product=firefox, title="test firefox bug",
...     comment="blah blah blah", owner=foobar, private=True)
>>> notify(SQLObjectCreatedEvent(added_bug))
>>> private_bug = bugset.get(added_bug.id)

*only* the submitter is explicitly subscribed:

>>> print [subscription.person.id for subscription in private_bug.subscriptions]
[16]

It's up to the submitter to explicitly subscribe the maintainer, if
they so choose.

Note that this works similarly for distributions; in this case the
"maintainer" is considered the person who maintains the applicable
sourcepackage. E.g.

>>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import (
...     IDistributionSet, ISourcePackageNameSet)
>>> distributionset = getUtility(IDistributionSet)
>>> spnset = getUtility(ISourcePackageNameSet)
>>> ubuntu = distributionset.get(1)
>>> evolution = spnset.get(9)
>>> added_bug = getUtility(IBugSet).createBug(
...     distribution=ubuntu, sourcepackagename=evolution,
...     title="test firefox bug", comment="blah blah blah",
...     owner=foobar, private=True)
>>> notify(SQLObjectCreatedEvent(added_bug))
>>> private_bug = bugset.get(added_bug.id)
>>> print [subscription.person.id for subscription in private_bug.subscriptions]
[16]

Note that there are some IBugTargets that don't allow bugs to be directly filed
on them, e.g. IDistroRelease and ISourcePackage.

>>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IDistroReleaseSet

>>> ubuntu_warty = getUtility(IDistroReleaseSet).get(1)
>>> ubuntu_warty_firefox = ubuntu_warty.getSourcePackage("mozilla-firefox")
>>> ubuntu_warty.createBug(
...     owner=getUtility(ILaunchBag).user, title="test", comment="test")
Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
NotImplementedError: A new bug cannot be filed directly on a distribution release, because releases are meant for "targeting" a fix to a specific release. It's possible that we may change this behaviour to allow filing a bug on a distribution release in the not-too-distant future. For now, you probably meant to file the bug on the distribution instead.
>>> ubuntu_warty_firefox.createBug(
...     owner=getUtility(ILaunchBag).user, title="test", comment="test")
Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
NotImplementedError: A new bug cannot be filed directly on a source package in a specific distribution release, because releases are meant for "targeting" a fix to a specific release. It's possible that we may change this behaviour to allow filing a bug on a distribution release source package in the not-too-distant future. For now, you probably meant to file the bug on the distro-wide (i.e. not release-specific) source package.
