Ticket Tracking System
======================

ITicketTarget
-------------

Launchpad includes a tech support ticket tracker. Currently tickets can
be created on products, distributions and source packages. To indicate
that tickets can be created on something, ITicketTarget is used.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import ITicketTarget

Let's check that the current ticket targets provide the necessary
interface, methods and attributes.

Product
^^^^^^^

    >>> from zope.interface.verify import verifyObject
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IProductSet
    >>> firefox = getUtility(IProductSet)['firefox']
    >>> verifyObject(ITicketTarget, firefox)
    True

Create a ticket:

    >>> login('test@canonical.com')
    >>> sample_person = getUtility(ILaunchBag).user
    >>> firefox_ticket = firefox.newTicket(
    ...     sample_person, "Firefox ticket", "Unable to use Firefox")
    >>> firefox_ticket.target == firefox
    True

The submitter, Sample Person, got subscribed to the ticket:

    >>> sample_person in [
    ...     subscription.person
    ...     for subscription in firefox_ticket.subscriptions]
    True

See all the tickets:

    >>> [(ticket.id, ticket.title) for ticket in firefox.tickets()]
    [(8L, u'Firefox ticket'),
     (6, u"Newly installed plug-in doesn't seem to be used"),
     (4, u'Firefox loses focus and gets stuck'),
     (2, u'Problem showing the SVG demo on W3C site'),
     (1, u'Firefox cannot render Bank Site')]

Get an existing ticket:

    >>> ticket_four = firefox.getTicket(4)
    >>> ticket_four.title
    u'Firefox loses focus and gets stuck'

Get a non-existing ticket, or a ticket for another target:

    >>> firefox.getTicket(12345) is None
    True

    >>> firefox.getTicket(3) is None
    True


Distribution
^^^^^^^^^^^^

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IDistributionSet
    >>> ubuntu = getUtility(IDistributionSet).getByName('ubuntu')
    >>> verifyObject(ITicketTarget, ubuntu)
    True

Create a ticket:

    >>> ubuntu_ticket = ubuntu.newTicket(
    ...     sample_person, "Ubuntu ticket", "Unable to use Ubuntu")
    >>> ubuntu_ticket.target == ubuntu
    True

The submitter, Sample Person, got subscribed to the ticket:

    >>> sample_person in [
    ...     subscription.person
    ...     for subscription in ubuntu_ticket.subscriptions]
    True

See all the tickets:

    >>> [(ticket.id, ticket.title) for ticket in ubuntu.tickets()]
    [(9L, u'Ubuntu ticket'),
     (7, u'Slow system'),
     (5, u'Installation failed'),
     (3, u'Firefox is slow and consumes too much RAM')]

Get an existing ticket:

    >>> ticket_three = ubuntu.getTicket(3)
    >>> ticket_three.title
    u'Firefox is slow and consumes too much RAM'

Get a non-existing ticket, or a ticket for another target:

    >>> ubuntu.getTicket(12345) is None
    True

    >>> ubuntu.getTicket(4) is None
    True

Source Package
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A source package is a special ITicketTarget. It supports all the method
and attributes, but the tickets associated with a source package wont'
have the source package as their target. Instead the source package's
distribution will be the target.

    >>> firefox_package = ubuntu.currentrelease.getSourcePackage(
    ...     'mozilla-firefox')
    >>> verifyObject(ITicketTarget, firefox_package)
    True

Create a ticket:

    >>> firefox_package_ticket = firefox_package.newTicket(
    ...     sample_person, "Ubuntu Firefox ticket",
    ...     "Unable to use Firefox in Ubuntu.")
    >>> firefox_package_ticket.target == ubuntu
    True

The submitter, Sample Person, got subscribed to the ticket:

    >>> sample_person in [
    ...     subscription.person
    ...     for subscription in firefox_package_ticket.subscriptions]
    True

See all the tickets:

    >>> [(ticket.id, ticket.title) for ticket in firefox_package.tickets()]
    [(10L, u'Ubuntu Firefox ticket'),
     (3, u'Firefox is slow and consumes too much RAM')]

Get an existing ticket:

    >>> ticket_three = firefox_package.getTicket(3)
    >>> ticket_three.title
    u'Firefox is slow and consumes too much RAM'

Get a non-existing ticket, or a ticket for another target:

    >>> firefox_package.getTicket(12345) is None
    True

    >>> firefox_package.getTicket(5) is None
    True


ITicket
-------

Now we take a look at a ticket and see what we can do with it.
Sample Person was the one who filed the ticket, so he can close the
ticket if he thinks it's not relevant anymore:

    >>> firefox_ticket.mark_resolved(sample_person)
    >>> firefox_ticket.status.title
    'Closed'

He can also reopen it:

    >>> firefox_ticket.reopen(sample_person)
    <TicketReopening at ...>
    >>> firefox_ticket.status.title
    'Open'

Now let's log in as another, non admin, to show that anyone can edit a
ticket. First of all the title and description don't say much about the
problem, so let's ask Sample Person to clarify.

    >>> login('no-priv@canonical.com')
    >>> no_priv = getUtility(ILaunchBag).user
    >>> comment = firefox_ticket.newMessage(
    ...     no_priv, firefox_ticket.followup_subject,
    ...     'Could you please describe what the problem is?')

We also assign the ticket to ourselves to show that we're working on
the issue.

    >>> firefox_ticket.assignee = no_priv

Sample Person replies:

    >>> login('test@canonical.com')
    >>> sample_person = getUtility(ILaunchBag).user
    >>> comment = firefox_ticket.newMessage(
    ...     sample_person, firefox_ticket.followup_subject,
    ...     'When I start Firefox, all I get is a blank page. I want to '
    ...     'have a search page at start-up?')

Now it's clear what the problem is, so let's edit the title and
description to describe the problem:

    >>> login('no-priv@canonical.com')
    >>> firefox_ticket.title = 'No home page is set.'
    >>> firefox_ticket.description = (
    ...     'When Firefox is started, an empty page is shown. I want a '
    ...     'search page to be shown.')

Let's help Sample Person with his problem by providing an answer:

    >>> comment = firefox_ticket.newMessage(
    ...     no_priv, firefox_ticket.followup_subject,
    ...     "Go to 'http://www.google.com', enter the preferences "
    ...     "dialog, and choose 'Use Current Page'.")
    >>> firefox_ticket.mark_resolved(no_priv)
    >>> firefox_ticket.status.title
    'Answered'

Sample Person is happy with the answer, so he closes the ticket:

    >>> login('test@canonical.com')
    >>> comment = firefox_ticket.newMessage(
    ...     sample_person, firefox_ticket.followup_subject, 'Thanks!')
    >>> firefox_ticket.mark_resolved(sample_person)
    >>> firefox_ticket.status.title
    'Closed'
