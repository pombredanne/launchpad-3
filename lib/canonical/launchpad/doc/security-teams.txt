Security Teams
==============

Responsibility for security-related bugs, are modelled in Launchpad with
a "security contact" on a Distribution or a Product.

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import (
    ...     IDistributionSet, IProductSet, IPersonSet, IHasSecurityContact)
    >>> personset = getUtility(IPersonSet)
    >>> productset = getUtility(IProductSet)
    >>> ubuntu = getUtility(IDistributionSet).get(1)
    >>> firefox = productset.get(4)

    >>> IHasSecurityContact.providedBy(ubuntu)
    True
    >>> IHasSecurityContact.providedBy(firefox)
    True

    >>> sabdfl = personset.get(1)
    >>> ubuntu_team = personset.get(17)

Security contacts are set through properties.

    >>> login("foo.bar@canonical.com")

    >>> ubuntu.security_contact = sabdfl
    >>> firefox.security_contact = ubuntu_team

    >>> print ubuntu.security_contact.name
    sabdfl

    >>> print firefox.security_contact.name
    ubuntu-team

When creating a bug, use the security_related flag to indicate that the
bug is a security vulnerability, and the security contact should be
subscribed to the bug, even when it's marked private.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import ILaunchBag, CreateBugParams

    >>> ubuntu_firefox = ubuntu.getSourcePackage("mozilla-firefox")
    >>> params = CreateBugParams(
    ...     owner=getUtility(ILaunchBag).user,
    ...     title="a security bug",
    ...     comment="this is an example security bug",
    ...     security_related=True, private=True)
    >>> bug = ubuntu.createBug(params)

    >>> bug.security_related
    True
    >>> bug.private
    True

The reporter, Foo Bar, and the Ubuntu security contact, Mark
Shuttleworth are both subscribed to the bug.

    >>> def subscriber_names(bug):
    ...     subscribers = (
    ...         bug.getDirectSubscribers() + bug.getIndirectSubscribers())
    ...     return sorted(subscriber.name for subscriber in subscribers)

    >>> subscriber_names(bug)
    [u'name16', u'sabdfl']

If the bug were not reported as security-related, only Foo Bar would
have been subscribed:

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import ILaunchBag

    >>> ubuntu_firefox = ubuntu.getSourcePackage("mozilla-firefox")
    >>> params = CreateBugParams(
    ...     owner=getUtility(ILaunchBag).user,
    ...     title="a security bug",
    ...     comment="this is an example security bug",
    ...     security_related=False)
    >>> bug = ubuntu.createBug(params)

    >>> bug.security_related
    False

    >>> subscriber_names(bug)
    [u'name16']

Likewise, filing a security-related bug on Firefox will subscribe the
security contact, the Ubuntu team, to the bug.

    >>> params = CreateBugParams(
    ...     owner=getUtility(ILaunchBag).user,
    ...     title="another security bug",
    ...     comment="this is another security bug",
    ...     security_related=True, private=True)
    >>> bug = firefox.createBug(params)

    >>> bug.security_related
    True
    >>> bug.private
    True

    >>> subscriber_names(bug)
    [u'name16', u'ubuntu-team']

Again, if the bug were not reported as security-related, the security
contact, the Ubuntu Team, would not have been subscribed:

    >>> params = CreateBugParams(
    ...     owner=getUtility(ILaunchBag).user,
    ...     title="another security bug",
    ...     comment="this is another security bug",
    ...     security_related=False)
    >>> bug = firefox.createBug(params)

    >>> bug.security_related
    False

    >>> subscriber_names(bug)
    [u'name12', u'name16']

When no security contact exists, only the reporter and product
registrant get subscribed.

    >>> firefox.security_contact = None

    >>> print firefox.owner.name
    name12

    >>> params = CreateBugParams(
    ...     owner=getUtility(ILaunchBag).user,
    ...     title="another security bug",
    ...     comment="this is another security bug",
    ...     security_related=True, private=True)

    >>> bug = firefox.createBug(params)

    >>> bug.security_related
    True

    >>> subscriber_names(bug)
    [u'name12', u'name16']

When a bug is reported in another package or upstream, the security
contact for that package or upstream is automatically subscribed to the
bug, *if the bug is public*. Malone never auto-subscribes anyone to
private bugs, except when the user chooses that option when filing a
security bug.

Let's first demonstrate adding a task to a public bug causing the
security contact of the new product to be subscribed.

    >>> evolution = productset.get(5)

We'll set lifeless as the security_contact for evolution.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IBugTaskSet

(Make the bug public to ensure the security contact will get
subscribed.)

    >>> bug.setPrivate(False, getUtility(ILaunchBag).user)
    True

    >>> lifeless = personset.get(2)
    >>> print lifeless.name
    lifeless
    >>> evolution.security_contact = lifeless

    >>> foobar = personset.get(16)
    >>> print foobar.name
    name16

    >>> bugtaskset = getUtility(IBugTaskSet)
    >>> bug_in_evolution = bugtaskset.createTask(
    ...     bug=bug, product=evolution, owner=foobar)

lifeless is subscribed to the public security bug when a task is added
for evolution.

    >>> subscriber_names(bug)
    [u'lifeless', u'name12', u'name16']

But if we repeat the process, using a private bug, he won't be
subscribed.

    >>> params = CreateBugParams(
    ...     owner=getUtility(ILaunchBag).user,
    ...     title="another security bug",
    ...     comment="this is private security bug",
    ...     private=True, security_related=True)
    >>> bug = firefox.createBug(params)

    >>> bug.security_related
    True

    >>> bug.private
    True

    >>> subscriber_names(bug)
    [u'name12', u'name16']

    >>> bug_in_evolution = bugtaskset.createTask(
    ...     bug=bug, product=evolution, owner=foobar)

    >>> subscriber_names(bug)
    [u'name12', u'name16']

Finally, reassigning a public bug to a different product will subscribe
the new security contact, if present. Let's set stub to the security
contact for thunderbird to see how this works.

    >>> thunderbird = productset.get(8)
    >>> print thunderbird.name
    thunderbird

    >>> stub = personset.get(22)
    >>> print stub.name
    stub

    >>> thunderbird.security_contact = stub

    >>> from zope.event import notify
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.event.sqlobjectevent import (
    ...     SQLObjectModifiedEvent)
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.webapp.snapshot import Snapshot
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IUpstreamBugTask

    >>> old_state = Snapshot(bug_in_evolution, providing=IUpstreamBugTask)
    >>> bug_in_evolution.product = thunderbird
    >>> bug_product_changed = SQLObjectModifiedEvent(
    ...     bug_in_evolution, old_state, ["product"])

First, let's publish the change event with the bug still marked private,
and notice that the subscription list doesn't change:

    >>> bug.private
    True

    >>> notify(bug_product_changed)

    >>> subscriber_names(bug)
    [u'name12', u'name16']

But publish the same event again, when the bug is marked public, and
stub will be added to the subscriber list:

    >>> bug.setPrivate(False, getUtility(ILaunchBag).user)
    True

    >>> notify(bug_product_changed)

    >>> subscriber_names(bug)
    [u'name12', u'name16', u'stub']
