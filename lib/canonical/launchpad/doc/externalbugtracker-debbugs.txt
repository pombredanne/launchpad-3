= ExternalBugTracker: DebBugs =

Differently from Bugzilla, debbugs watch syncing is done by reading from
a local database, so we can use a real class for testing: we just need
to point it to our test debbugs db. Let's set up the db location for our
test:

    >>> import os.path
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.components.ftests import __file__
    >>> from canonical.config import config
    >>> OLD_DEBBUGS_LOCATION = config.malone.debbugs_db_location
    >>> test_db_location = os.path.join(
    ...     os.path.dirname(__file__), 'debbugs_db')
    >>> config.malone.debbugs_db_location = test_db_location

You can specify the db_location explicitly:

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.components.externalbugtracker import (
    ...     DebBugs)
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests.externalbugtracker import (
    ...     new_bugtracker)
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import BugTrackerType
    >>> from canonical.testing import LaunchpadZopelessLayer
    >>> txn = LaunchpadZopelessLayer.txn
    >>> debbugs = new_bugtracker(BugTrackerType.DEBBUGS)
    >>> external_debbugs = DebBugs(txn, debbugs, db_location=test_db_location)
    >>> external_debbugs.db_location == test_db_location
    True

Or, if we create a DebBugs instance without specifying a db location, it
will use the config value:

    >>> external_debbugs = DebBugs(txn, debbugs)
    >>> external_debbugs.db_location == config.malone.debbugs_db_location
    True


== Retrieving bug status from the debbugs database ==

The retrieval of the remote status is done through the
getRemoteStatus() method. If we pass a bug number that doesn't exist in
the debbugs db, BugNotFound is raised.

    >>> external_debbugs.getRemoteStatus('42')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    BugNotFound: 42

If we pass a non-integer bug id, InvalidBugId is raised.

    >>> external_debbugs.getRemoteStatus('foo')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    InvalidBugId: Debbugs bug number not an integer: foo

The debbugs database has two subdirectories in it. The db-h directory
contains current bugs, while the archive contains older bugs that have
been moved there manually. The DebBugs wrapper fetches bugs from them
transparently. Bug 237001 lives in db-h:

    >>> external_debbugs.getRemoteStatus('237001')
    'open normal'

Bug 563 resides in the archive. It is also fetchable:

    >>> external_debbugs.getRemoteStatus('563')
    'done normal'


== Checking debbugs bug watches ==

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IBugTrackerSet
    >>> debbugs = getUtility(IBugTrackerSet).getByName('debbugs')
    >>> bug_watches = list(debbugs.getBugWatchesNeedingUpdate(23))
    >>> len(bug_watches)
    4

Log in and kick off the update. The importing of comments, which is
controlled by a configuration option, is disabled here and will be
tested later.

    >>> external_debbugs.import_comments = False
    >>> external_debbugs.updateBugWatches(bug_watches)
    INFO:...:Updating 4 watches on http://bugs.some.where

    >>> for bug_watch in bug_watches:
    ...     print "%s: %s" % (bug_watch.remotebug, bug_watch.remotestatus)
    280883: done grave woody security
    304014: open important
    327452: done critical patch security
    327549: open important security

The lastchecked attribute got updated for each bug watch, so no more
watches are in need of an update:

    >>> flush_database_updates()
    >>> debbugs.getBugWatchesNeedingUpdate(23).count()
    0

And the linked bugtasks got updated:

    >>> import operator
    >>> bugtasks = []
    >>> for bug_watch in bug_watches:
    ...     bugtasks += list(bug_watch.bugtasks)
    >>> for bugtask in sorted(bugtasks, key=operator.attrgetter('id')):
    ...     print bugtask.bug.id, bugtask.bugtargetname, bugtask.status.title,
    ...     print bugtask.importance.title
    1 mozilla-firefox (Debian) New Unknown
    3 mozilla-firefox (Debian Sarge) New Unknown
    7 evolution (Debian) Fix Released Unknown

Sometimes the severity field is missing in the bug summary. That will
cause importance to be set to medium, equivalent to the default normal severity
in debbugs.

    >>> import email
    >>> summary = email.message_from_file(
    ...     open(os.path.join(
    ...         test_db_location, 'db-h', '01', '237001.summary')))
    >>> 'Severity' not in summary
    True

    >>> external_debbugs.getRemoteStatus('237001')
    'open normal'


== Debbugs status conversions ==

Let's take closer look at the status conversion. Debbugs has basically
only two statuses, 'open' and 'done', so in order to get a more fine
grained mapping to Malone statuses, we need to look at the tags as
well. The most simple mapping is from 'done', in debbugs it means that
the bug has been fixed and a new package with the fix has been
uploaded, so it maps to 'Fix Released.

    >>> print external_debbugs.convertRemoteStatus('done normal').title
    Fix Released

If the status is simply 'open', we map it to 'New', since
there's no way of knowing if the bug is confirmed or not.

    >>> print external_debbugs.convertRemoteStatus('open normal').title
    New

If the 'wontfix' tag is present we map it to "Won't Fix". The 'wontfix'
tag takes precedence over the confimed tags (help, confirmed, upstream,
fixed-upstream) since 'wontfix' is the state after confirmed. The 'wontfix'
tag also takes precedence over the fix-committed tags (pending, fixed,
fixed-in-experimental) since the malone status will correctly change to
fix-released when the debbugs status changes to 'done', so a nonsensical
combination of 'fixed' & 'wontfix' tags will only affect the malone status
temporarily.

    >>> print external_debbugs.convertRemoteStatus(
    ...         'open normal pending fixed fixed-in-experimental'
    ...         ' wontfix help confirmed upstream fixed-upstream').title
    Won't Fix

If the 'moreinfo' tag is present, we map the status to 'Needs Info'.

    >>> print external_debbugs.convertRemoteStatus(
    ...     'open normal moreinfo').title
    Incomplete

Of course, if the 'moreinfo' tag is present and the status is 'done',
we still map to 'Fix Released'.

    >>> print external_debbugs.convertRemoteStatus(
    ...     'done normal moreinfo').title
    Fix Released

If the 'help' tag is present, it means that the maintainer is
requesting help with the bug, so it's most likely a confirmed bug.

    >>> print external_debbugs.convertRemoteStatus('open normal help').title
    Confirmed

The 'pending' tag means that a fix is about to be uploaded, so it maps
to 'Fix Committed'.

    >>> print external_debbugs.convertRemoteStatus('open normal pending').title
    Fix Committed

The 'fixed' tag means that the bug has been either fixed or work around
somehow, but there's still an issue to be solved. We map it to 'Fix
Committed', so that people can see that a fix is available.

    >>> print external_debbugs.convertRemoteStatus('open normal fixed').title
    Fix Committed

If the bug is forwarded upstream, it should mean that it's a confirmed
bug.

    >>> print external_debbugs.convertRemoteStatus(
    ...     'open normal upstream').title
    Confirmed

And of course, if the maintainer marked the bug as 'confirmed'.

    >>> print external_debbugs.convertRemoteStatus(
    ...     'open normal confirmed').title
    Confirmed


If it has been fixed upstream, it's definitely a confirmed bug.

    >>> print external_debbugs.convertRemoteStatus(
    ...     'open normal fixed-upstream').title
    Confirmed

If it has been fixed in experimental, we mark it 'Fix Committed' until
the fix has reached the unstable distribution.

    >>> print external_debbugs.convertRemoteStatus(
    ...     'open normal fixed-in-experimental').title
    Fix Committed

All other tags we map to 'New'.

    >>> print external_debbugs.convertRemoteStatus(
    ...     'open normal unreproducible lfs woody').title
    New

If we pass in a malformed status string, we map it to 'Unknown' and
log an error.

    >>> print external_debbugs.convertRemoteStatus('open').title
    ERROR:...:Malformed debbugs status: 'open'.
    Unknown

UNKNOWN_REMOTE_STATUS maps to Unknown.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import UNKNOWN_REMOTE_STATUS
    >>> print external_debbugs.convertRemoteStatus(UNKNOWN_REMOTE_STATUS).title
    Unknown


== Importing bugs ==

The Debbugs ExternalBugTracker can import a Debian bug into Launchpad.
It pulls a bug from the Debbugs db, and create a bug in Launchpad with
the same summary and description.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IDistributionSet
    >>> debian = getUtility(IDistributionSet).getByName('debian')
    >>> debian.official_malone
    False

The bug reporter doesn't have to have a Launchpad account. If a person
doesn't exist in Launchpad, a new one will be created automatically.

    >>> report = email.message_from_file(
    ...     open(os.path.join(
    ...         test_db_location, 'db-h', '35', '322535.report')))
    >>> print report['From']
    Moritz Muehlenhoff <jmm@inutil.org>

    >>> from email.Utils import parseaddr
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IPersonSet
    >>> reporter_name, reporter_email = parseaddr(report['From'])
    >>> print getUtility(IPersonSet).getByEmail(reporter_email)
    None

The importBug method reads the bug report from the debbugs db,
and creates a Launchpad bug report, using the debbugs subject as the
summary, and the description as the description.

    >>> print report['Subject']
    evolution: Multiple format string vulnerabilities in Evolution

    >>> print report.get_payload(decode=True)
    Package: evolution
    Severity: grave
    Tags: security
    <BLANKLINE>
    Multiple exploitable format string vulnerabilities have been found in
    Evolution. Please see
    http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/407789/30/0/threaded
    for details. 2.3.7 fixes all these issues.
    ...

    >>> bug = external_debbugs.importBug(debian, '322535')
    INFO:...:Updating 1 watches on http://bugs.some.where

    >>> print bug.title
    evolution: Multiple format string vulnerabilities in Evolution
    >>> print bug.description

    ...

The bug reporter got created automatically:

    >>> getUtility(IPersonSet).getByEmail(reporter_email) is not None
    True
    >>> print bug.owner.displayname
    Moritz Muehlenhoff

Since he didn't have a Launchpad account before, he doesn't have a
preferred e-mail address, and the one that is associated with his
account is marked as NEW, since we don't know whether it's valid.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IEmailAddressSet
    >>> reporter_email_adresses = getUtility(IEmailAddressSet).getByPerson(
    ...     bug.owner)
    >>> for email_address in reporter_email_adresses:
    ...     print "%s: %s" % (email_address.email, email_address.status.name)
    jmm@inutil.org: NEW
    >>> print bug.owner.preferredemail
    None

    >>> bug.owner.creation_rationale.name
    'BUGIMPORT'
    >>> bug.owner.creation_comment
    u'when importing debbugs bug #322535'

No one got subscribed to the created bug, since the relevant people
already get e-mail notifications via Debbugs.

    >>> [person.name for person in bug.getDirectSubscribers()]
    []

The bug got filed against the evolution package in Debian, and it has a
bug watch pointing to the original Debian bug, so that the bug report is
kept in sync.

    >>> [debian_task] = bug.bugtasks
    >>> debian_task.bugtargetname
    u'evolution (Debian)'

    >>> debian_task.bugwatch.bugtracker.name
    u'debbugs-checkwatches-1'
    >>> debian_task.bugwatch.remotebug
    u'322535'


=== Non-existent source package ===

If a Debian package doesn't exist in Launchpad already, it will be
filed on Debian itself, with no source package specified. The package is
always included in the description of Debian bugs, so that information
isn't lost. A warning is also logged, so that the one running the script
gets notified about it.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests.externalbugtracker import (
    ...     TestDebBugs, TestDebianBug)
    >>> external_debbugs = TestDebBugs(
    ...     txn, debbugs, {'1234': TestDebianBug(package='no-such-package')})
    >>> print debian.getSourcePackage('no-such-package')
    None
    >>> bug = external_debbugs.importBug(debian, '1234')
    WARNING:...:Unknown Debian package (debbugs #1234): no-such-package
    INFO:...:Updating 1 watches on http://bugs.debian.org

    >>> [debian_task] = bug.bugtasks
    >>> debian_task.distribution.name
    u'debian'
    >>> print debian_task.sourcepackagename
    None


=== Syncing status ===

After the bug watch has been created for the imported bug, the status is
synced immediately.

    >>> external_debbugs = TestDebBugs(
    ...     txn, debbugs, {'1234': TestDebianBug(status='done')})
    >>> expected_status = external_debbugs.convertRemoteStatus(
    ...     external_debbugs.getRemoteStatus('1234'))
    >>> expected_status.name
    'FIXRELEASED'
    >>> bug = external_debbugs.importBug(debian, '1234')
    INFO:...:Updating 1 watches on http://bugs.debian.org

    >>> [debian_task] = bug.bugtasks
    >>> debian_task.status.name
    'FIXRELEASED'


=== Reporter already registered in Launchpad ===

Even if the reporter of the bug has an account in Launchpad (and thus a
valid e-mail address), he still won't be subscribed to the imported bug.

    >>> no_priv = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('no-priv')
    >>> no_priv.preferredemail is not None
    True
    >>> no_priv_bug = TestDebianBug(
    ...     reporter_email=no_priv.preferredemail.email)
    >>> external_debbugs = TestDebBugs(txn, debbugs, {'1234': no_priv_bug})
    >>> bug = external_debbugs.importBug(debian, '1234')
    INFO:...:Updating 1 watches on http://bugs.debian.org

    >>> bug.owner.name
    u'no-priv'
    >>> [person.name for person in bug.getDirectSubscribers()]
    []


== Importing Comments ==

Along with importing debian bug reports, comments on those bug reports
are also imported. This activity is usually carried out as part of a
status update (though this is disabled in our Test DebBugs
implementation), so we need to pass a bug watch to the function.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IBugSet
    >>> bug = getUtility(IBugSet).get(4)
    >>> bug_watch = bug.addWatch(debbugs, '1234', no_priv)
    >>> external_debbugs.importBugComments(bug_watch)
    INFO:...:Imported 1 comments for remote bug 1234...

These comments will have been added to the bug. If we look at the
message chunks for the bug we will see the comments that have been
imported, along with the creation comment of the bug.

    >>> chunks = bug.getMessageChunks()
    >>> for chunk_id, chunk in sorted([(chunk.id, chunk.content)
    ...     for chunk in chunks]):
    ...     print chunk
    Malone pages that use more complex layouts with portlets and fancy
    CSS are sometimes not getting properly reflowed after rendering.
    Things happen.

The author of the comment will have had a Launchpad Person created for
them if they didn't exist already:

    >>> message = chunks[0].message
    >>> message.owner.displayname
    u'Teun Vink'

    >>> print message.owner.creation_comment
    when the comments for debbugs #1234 were imported into Launchpad.

No notifications will be generated for the imported comments:

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IBugNotificationSet
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.scripts.bugnotification import (
    ...     get_email_notifications)
    >>> pending_notifications = getUtility(
    ...     IBugNotificationSet).getNotificationsToSend()
    >>> len(pending_notifications)
    0

If a second comment is added and then the comments imported, the
existing comment will remain unaltered and the new comment will be
imported into Launchpad as normal. We can demonstrate this by telling
our test debbugs DB to load sample data for more than one comment

    >>> chunks = bug.getMessageChunks()
    >>> len(chunks)
    2

    >>> external_debbugs.debbugs_db._data_file = 'debbugs-2-comments.txt'
    >>> external_debbugs.importBugComments(bug_watch)
    INFO:...:Imported 1 comments for remote bug 1234...

    >>> chunks = bug.getMessageChunks()
    >>> len(chunks)
    3

    >>> for chunk_id, chunk in sorted([(chunk.id, chunk.content)
    ...     for chunk in chunks]):
    ...     print chunk
    Malone pages that use more complex layouts with portlets and fancy
    CSS are sometimes not getting properly reflowed after rendering.
    Things happen.
    Anything that, in happening, causes something else to happen, causes
    something else to happen.

If a comment already exists in our database and is then imported from
the debbugs database, it will be linked to the bug then next time the
comment import code runs. We can demonstrate this by adding a new
message:

    >>> import os
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IMessageSet
    >>> msg_path = os.path.join(external_debbugs.debbugs_db._data_path,
    ...     'debbugs-existing-comment.txt')
    >>> msg_string = open(msg_path).read()
    >>> message = getUtility(IMessageSet).fromEmail(msg_string)

If we run the import against the same data file - thus finding the same
message - the comment will be linked to the bug, but will not show as
having been imported since the comment hasn't been created afresh.

    >>> external_debbugs.debbugs_db._data_file = (
    ...     'debbugs-existing-comment.txt')
    >>> external_debbugs.importBugComments(bug_watch)

    >>> chunks = bug.getMessageChunks()
    >>> len(chunks)
    4

    >>> for chunk_id, chunk in sorted([(chunk.id, chunk.content)
    ...     for chunk in chunks]):
    ...     print chunk
    Malone pages that use more complex layouts with portlets and fancy
    CSS are sometimes not getting properly reflowed after rendering.
    Things happen.
    Anything that, in happening, causes something else to happen, causes
    something else to happen.
    It doesn't necessarily happen in that order, though.

    >>> from canonical.database.sqlbase import commit
    >>> commit()

A config option, malone.show_imported_comments, controls whether or not
imported comments will be displayed. We can demonstrate these using the
standard BugTaskView for the bug above.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.browser import BugTaskView
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.webapp.servers import (
    ...     LaunchpadTestRequest)
    >>> from canonical.testing import LaunchpadZopelessLayer
    >>> LaunchpadZopelessLayer.switchDbUser('launchpad')
    >>> view = BugTaskView(bug.bugtasks[0], LaunchpadTestRequest())

By default, the comments returned which have been imported from a bug
watch will have a can_be_shown property of False.

    >>> for comment in view.getBugCommentsForDisplay():
    ...     comment.can_be_shown
    True
    False
    False

However, if we set the show_imported_comments config option to True, the
imported comments for bug 4 will be displayable.

    >>> from canonical.config import config
    >>> config.malone.show_imported_comments = True
    >>> view = BugTaskView(bug.bugtasks[0], LaunchpadTestRequest())
    >>> for comment in view.getBugCommentsForDisplay():
    ...     comment.can_be_shown
    True
    True
    True

    >>> LaunchpadZopelessLayer.switchDbUser(config.checkwatches.dbuser)


=== Script for importing Debian bugs, linking them to Ubutu ===

There's a script called `import-debian-bugs.py`, which accepts a list of
bug numbers to be imported. It will link the bugs to the debbugs bug
tracker.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import ILaunchpadCelebrities
    >>> from canonical.database.sqlbase import commit
    >>> debbugs = getUtility(ILaunchpadCelebrities).debbugs
    >>> [bug.title for bug in debbugs.getBugsWatching('237001')]
    []
    >>> [bug.title for bug in debbugs.getBugsWatching('322535')]
    []
    >>> commit()

    >>> import subprocess
    >>> process = subprocess.Popen(
    ...     'scripts/import-debian-bugs.py 237001 322535', shell=True,
    ...     stdin=subprocess.PIPE, stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
    ...     stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
    >>> (out, err) = process.communicate()
    >>> process.returncode
    0
    >>> print err
    INFO    Updating 1 watches on http://bugs.debian.org
    INFO    Imported 3 comments for remote bug 237001...
    INFO    Imported debbugs #237001 as Launchpad bug #...
    INFO    Imported debbugs #322535 as Launchpad bug #...
    INFO    Committing the transaction.

    >>> commit()
    >>> debbugs = getUtility(ILaunchpadCelebrities).debbugs
    >>> [bug.title for bug in debbugs.getBugsWatching('237001')]
    [u'evolution mail crashes on opening an email with a TIFF attachment']
    >>> [bug.title for bug in debbugs.getBugsWatching('322535')]
    [u'evolution: Multiple format string vulnerabilities in Evolution']

In addition to simply importing the bugs and linking it to the debbugs
bug, it will also create an Ubuntu task for the imported bugs. This will
allow Ubuntu triagers to go through all the imported bugs and decide
whether they affects Ubuntu.

    >>> [imported_bug] = debbugs.getBugsWatching('237001')
    >>> for bugtask in imported_bug.bugtasks:
    ...     print "%s: %s" % (bugtask.bugtargetname, bugtask.status.name)
    evolution (Ubuntu): NEW
    evolution (Debian): NEW


==== Importing bugs twice ====

If a Debian bug already exists in Launchpad (i.e it has a bug watch), it
won't be imported again. A warning is logged so that the person runnning
the script gets notified about it.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.scripts.importdebianbugs import (
    ...     import_debian_bugs)
    >>> [bug.id for bug in debbugs.getBugsWatching('304014')]
    [1]
    >>> import_debian_bugs(['304014'])
    WARNING:...:Not importing debbugs #304014, since it's already
                linked from LP bug(s) #1.
    >>> [bug.id for bug in debbugs.getBugsWatching('304014')]
    [1]
