== The nascent uploads ==

(First some setup. We need a librarian for this test.)

  >>> from canonical.librarian.ftests.harness import LibrarianTestSetup
  >>> LibrarianTestSetup().setUp()

We also need to set up the OpenPGP key used to sign things so that we can
identify the upload signer later on.

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IGPGKeySet
  >>> from canonical.lp.dbschema import GPGKeyAlgorithm
  >>> discarded_key = getUtility(IGPGKeySet).new(26, '20687895',
  ...     '961F4EB829D7D304A77477822BC8401620687895', 1024, GPGKeyAlgorithm.D)

Next we import the test keys so we have them ready for verification

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests import import_public_test_keys
  >>> import_public_test_keys()

We need to be logged into the security model in order to get any further

  >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')

For the purpose of this test, hoary needs to be an open (development)
distrorelease so that we can upload to it.

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IDistributionSet
  >>> ubuntu = getUtility(IDistributionSet)['ubuntu']
  >>> hoary = ubuntu['hoary']
  >>> from canonical.lp.dbschema import DistributionReleaseStatus
  >>> hoary.releasestatus = DistributionReleaseStatus.DEVELOPMENT

A nascent upload is a collection of files in a directory. They
represent what may turn out to be an acceptible upload to a launchpad
managed archive.

  >>> from canonical.archivepublisher.nascentupload import NascentUpload
  >>> from canonical.archivepublisher.uploadpolicy import findPolicyByName
  >>> from canonical.archivepublisher.tests import datadir

  >>> class MockLogger:
  ...     def debug(self, s):
  ...         print "DEBUG:", s

The policy we feed to to the nascent upload needs to have its command
line options passed in.

  >>> class MockOptions:
  ...     distro = "ubuntu"
  ...     distrorelease = "hoary"

  >>> class BuilddOptions(MockOptions):
  ...     buildid = 1

  >>> buildd_policy = findPolicyByName('buildd')
  >>> buildd_policy.setOptions(BuilddOptions())

When initially constructing a NascentUpload instance, it verifies that
the changes file specified exists, raising FileNotFound if it does not.

  >>> NascentUpload(buildd_policy, datadir(""), "DOES-NOT-EXIST",
  ...     MockLogger())
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
  FileNotFound: DOES-NOT-EXIST
  >>> ed_upload = NascentUpload(findPolicyByName('insecure'),
  ...     datadir(''), "ed_0.2-20_i386.changes", MockLogger())
  >>> ed_upload.changes_filename == datadir("ed_0.2-20_i386.changes")
  True
  >>> ed_upload.policy.setOptions(MockOptions())

The nascent upload contains files (assuming it's sane) and as such we
have a NascentUploadedFile type to represent them.

  >>> from canonical.archivepublisher.nascentupload import NascentUploadedFile

To construct a nascentuploadedfile we need an fsroot and a line from a
Files section of a changes file.

  >>> nuf = NascentUploadedFile(
  ...     datadir(''),
  ...     ' 0c466ce6a160c62fa558fbbb46a4ea45 44718 editors important '
  ...     'ed_0.2-20_i386.deb')
  >>> nuf.filename
  'ed_0.2-20_i386.deb'
  >>> nuf._size
  44718
  >>> nuf._digest
  '0c466ce6a160c62fa558fbbb46a4ea45'
  >>> nuf.section
  'editors'
  >>> nuf.priority
  'important'

When we ask the object for its size or digest through the properties,
it will check them. If they're correct, no exception will be raised.

  >>> nuf.size
  44718
  >>> nuf.digest
  '0c466ce6a160c62fa558fbbb46a4ea45'
  >>> nuf.sha_digest
  'e5c467ca14ab67f73f8cbb9bb9016f670b14c8b7'
  >>> nuf._values_checked
  True

Going back to the upload itself, at a very basic level a NascentUpload
allows us to probe the contents of the changes file to see things like
the maintainer.

  >>> ed_upload.changes['maintainer']
  'James Troup <james@nocrew.org>'

We can also extract the list of files from the upload. If this raises
an exception then the file list is utterly broken.

  >>> for uploaded_file in ed_upload.files:
  ...     print uploaded_file.filename
  ed_0.2-20.dsc
  ed_0.2-20.diff.gz
  ed_0.2-20_i386.deb

The nascent upload can tell us if it is sourceful or not, (ditto binaryful)

  >>> ed_upload.sourceful
  True
  >>> ed_upload.binaryful
  True
  >>> ed_upload.archindep
  False
  >>> ed_upload.archdep
  True

  >>> ed_source_upload = NascentUpload(buildd_policy,
  ...     datadir(''), "ed_0.2-20_i386.source-only-unsigned-changes",
  ...     MockLogger)
  >>> ed_source_upload.sourceful
  True
  >>> ed_source_upload.binaryful
  False

  >>> ed_binary_upload = NascentUpload(buildd_policy,
  ...     datadir(''), "ed_0.2-20_i386.binary-only-unsigned-changes",
  ...     MockLogger)
  >>> ed_binary_upload.sourceful
  False
  >>> ed_binary_upload.binaryful
  True
  >>> ed_binary_upload.archdep
  True
  >>> ed_binary_upload.archindep
  False


If the Architecture line does not match then we get an exception.

  >>> ed_mismatched_upload = NascentUpload(buildd_policy,
  ...     datadir(''), "ed_0.2-20_i386.mismatched-arch-unsigned-changes",
  ...     MockLogger())
  >>> ed_mismatched_upload.sourceful
  True
  >>> ed_mismatched_upload.rejection_message
  'Mismatch in binaryfulness. (arch) False != (files) True\nOne or more files uploaded with specific architecture but changes file does not list it.'

We can distinguish between the arch-indep and arch-dep binary uploads.

  >>> quodlibet = NascentUpload(buildd_policy,
  ...     datadir(''), "quodlibet_0.13.1-1_i386.changes", MockLogger())
  >>> quodlibet.sourceful
  False
  >>> quodlibet.binaryful
  True
  >>> quodlibet.archdep
  True
  >>> quodlibet.archindep
  True

We can ask sourceful uploads if they are native or not. If they are
not native we can find out if they have an orig.tar.gz or not.

  >>> ed_upload.native
  False
  >>> ed_upload.hasorig
  False

If we ask a non-sourceful upload about its native or hasorig status it
should throw an exception because non-sourceful uploads have no
concept of nativeness.

  >>> ed_binary_upload.native
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
  UploadError: Attempted to ask a non-sourceful upload if it is native or not.


We can parse addresses and look them up in launchpad.

  >>> addr = ed_upload.parse_address("Foo Bar <foo.bar@canonical.com>")
  >>> addr['person'].displayname
  u'Foo Bar'

If the address is unparsable, we get an error.

  >>> ed_upload.parse_address("Cannot Parse Me <FOOO>")
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
  UploadError: Cannot Parse Me <FOOO>: no @ found in email address part.



The upload can extract distributions and distroreleases if it tries
  >>> ed_upload.distro.name
  u'ubuntu'
  >>> ed_upload.distrorelease.name
  u'hoary'

The policy we've used so far won't allow us to upload binary or
mixed-mode sets. We'll override this for our test set...

  >>> ed_upload.policy.can_upload_binaries = True
  >>> ed_upload.policy.can_upload_mixed = True

Finally we can ask the upload to process itself.
  >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import (
  ...     SourcePackageName, BinaryPackageName, DistroRelease)
  >>> hoary = DistroRelease.get(3)
  >>> saved_list = hoary.changeslist
  >>> hoary.changeslist = "dapper-announce@lists.ubuntu.com"
  >>> hoary.sync()
  >>> ed_upload.distrorelease.changeslist
  u'dapper-announce@lists.ubuntu.com'

Retrive the just-inserted SourcePackageRelease correspondent to 'ed'
(it's the only one we have, the process to retrieve a non-published
SPR w/o at least and DRQ entry is quite unusual)

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import (
  ...     SourcePackageRelease, SourcePackageName)
  >>> ed_name = SourcePackageName.selectOneBy(name='ed')
  >>> ed_spr = SourcePackageRelease.selectBy(sourcepackagenameID=ed_name.id)[0]

Check if we have rebuid the change's author line properly (as
mentioned in bug # 30621)

   -- James Troup <james@nocrew.org>  Wed,  2 Apr 2003 17:19:47 +0100

Roll back everything so that we can try again

  >>> import transaction
  >>> transaction.abort()

First up, construct an upload of just the ed source...

  >>> class MockMunchyLogger:
  ...     def debug(self, s):
  ...         pass

  >>> ed_src = NascentUpload(findPolicyByName('sync'), 
  ...          datadir('split-upload-test'), "ed_0.2-20_source.changes", 
  ...          MockMunchyLogger())
  >>> ed_src.policy.setOptions(MockOptions())
  >>> ed_src.process()
  >>> ed_src.rejected
  False
  >>> success, msgs = ed_src.do_accept()
  >>> success
  True

The ed source would be in NEW, so punt it into accepted.

  >>> from canonical.lp.dbschema import DistroReleaseQueueStatus
  >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import QueueInconsistentStateError
  >>> new_queue = hoary.getQueueItems(DistroReleaseQueueStatus.NEW)
  >>> for item in new_queue:
  ...     try:
  ...         print "%s/%s" % (item.sourcepackagename.name, 
  ...                          item.sourceversion)
  ...         item.setAccepted()
  ...         item.sync()
  ...     except QueueInconsistentStateError, info:
  ...         print info
  ed/0.2-20


Next we send in the binaries, since the source should be in ACCEPTED the
binary should go straight there too.

  >>> ed_bin = NascentUpload(findPolicyByName('sync'), 
  ...          datadir('split-upload-test'), "ed_0.2-20_i386.changes", 
  ...          MockMunchyLogger())
  >>> ed_bin.policy.setOptions(MockOptions())
  >>> ed_bin.policy.can_upload_binaries = True
  >>> ed_bin.process()
  >>> ed_bin.rejected
  False
  >>> print ed_bin.rejection_message+"\nEND"
  END
  >>> success, msgs = ed_bin.do_accept()
  >>> success
  True

Chuck it all away again

  >>> transaction.abort()

And this time, try an upload to -updates, it'll have to be signed etc because
we're using the insecure policy to check everything in it end-to-end. We have
to set hoary to CURRENT in order to do this because we're not allowed
to upload to -UPDATES in a DEVELOPMENT release.

  >>> hoary.releasestatus = DistributionReleaseStatus.CURRENT

  >>> ed_src = NascentUpload(findPolicyByName('sync'), 
  ...          datadir('updates-upload-test'), "ed_0.2-20_source.changes", 
  ...          MockMunchyLogger())
  >>> ed_src.policy.setOptions(MockOptions())
  >>> ed_src.policy.distrorelease = None # Override this by the changes
  >>> ed_src.process()
  >>> ed_src.rejected
  False
  >>> ed_src.rejection_message
  ''
  >>> success, msgs = ed_src.do_accept()
  >>> success
  True
  >>> print ed_src.queue_root.pocket.name
  UPDATES

Even though this went to a pocket and thus would be unapproved rather
than accepted, the ed upload ought still make it to NEW instead of
unapproved.

  >>> print ed_src.queue_root.status.name
  NEW

And pop it back to development now that we're done

  >>> hoary.releasestatus = DistributionReleaseStatus.DEVELOPMENT

Check the uploader behaviour against a missing orig.tar.gz file,
bug # 30741.

  >>> ed21_src = NascentUpload(findPolicyByName('sync'),
  ...          datadir('ed-0.2-21'), "ed_0.2-21_source.changes",
  ...          MockMunchyLogger())
  >>> ed21_src.policy.setOptions(MockOptions())
  >>> ed21_src.process()
  >>> ed21_src.rejected
  True
  >>> print ed21_src.rejection_message+"\nEND"
  Unable to find ed_0.2.orig.tar.gz in the distribution.
  END

Next let's throw the whole thing out again and try once more having purged
the ACLs for the uploader

  >>> transaction.abort()
  >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import DistroComponentUploader, Person
  >>> for x in DistroComponentUploader.select():
  ...     x.uploader = Person.get(1)

Ensure that the key is attached to the database...

  >>> discarded_key = getUtility(IGPGKeySet).new(26, '20687895',
  ...     '961F4EB829D7D304A77477822BC8401620687895', 1024, GPGKeyAlgorithm.D)

This time the upload should fail because the ACLs don't let person 26 upload

  >>> ed_src = NascentUpload(findPolicyByName('insecure'), 
  ...          datadir(''), "ed_0.2-20_i386.changes", 
  ...          MockMunchyLogger())
  >>> ed_src.policy.setOptions(MockOptions())
  >>> ed_src.policy.can_upload_binaries = True
  >>> ed_src.policy.can_upload_mixed = True
  >>> ed_src.process()
  >>> ed_src.rejected
  True
  >>> print ed_src.rejection_message+"\nEND"
  Signer has no upload rights at all to this distribution.
  END

(and some tear down)

  >>> transaction.abort()
  >>> LibrarianTestSetup().tearDown()
