= Person Pages =

There are many views that wrap the Person object to display the
person's information.


== Email address disclosure ==

PersonView is the base for many views for Person objects, including the
default view. It provides several properties to help display email
addresses.

Templates may use the state of the email_address_visibility property to
determine which message to show to the user. When the state is PUBLIC or
ALLOWED, the email_addresses property contains a list of the viewable
email addresses and the visible_email_address_description summarises who
can see them

Mark has a registered email address, and he has chosen to disclose it to
the world.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces.person import IPersonSet

    >>> person_set = getUtility(IPersonSet)
    >>> mark = person_set.getByEmail('mark@hbd.com')
    >>> mark.preferredemail.email
    u'mark@hbd.com'
    >>> mark.hide_email_addresses
    False

Anonymous users cannot see any Launchpad user's email addresses. The
email addresses state is LOGIN_REQUIRED, there is no description, nor
are there any email addresses.

    >>> view = create_initialized_view(mark, '+index')
    >>> view.email_address_visibility.is_login_required
    True
    >>> print view.visible_email_address_description
    None
    >>> view.visible_email_addresses
    []

Logged in user can see Mark's email addresses. The email addresses
state is PUBLIC. There is a description of who can see the list of
email addresses.

    >>> login('test@canonical.com')
    >>> view = create_initialized_view(mark, '+index')
    >>> view.email_address_visibility.are_public
    True
    >>> view.visible_email_address_description
    'This email address is only visible to Launchpad users.'
    >>> view.visible_email_addresses
    [u'mark@hbd.com']

As for Sample Person, he has chosen not to disclose his email addresses.

    >>> login(ANONYMOUS)
    >>> sample_person = person_set.getByEmail('test@canonical.com')
    >>> sample_person.hide_email_addresses
    True

Anonymous users can't see them because the state is LOGIN_REQUIRED.

    >>> view = create_initialized_view(sample_person, '+index')
    >>> view.email_address_visibility.is_login_required
    True
    >>> view.visible_email_addresses
    []

No Privileges Person cannot see them either because the state is
HIDDEN. There is no description for the email addresses because
he cannot view them.

    >>> login('no-priv@canonical.com')
    >>> view = create_initialized_view(sample_person, '+index')
    >>> view.email_address_visibility.are_hidden
    True
    >>> print view.visible_email_address_description
    None
    >>> view.visible_email_addresses
    []

Admins and commercial admins, like Foo Bar and Commercial Member, can
see Sample Person's email addresses because the state is ALLOWED.
The description states that the email addresses are not disclosed to
others.

    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')
    >>> view = create_initialized_view(sample_person, '+index')
    >>> view.email_address_visibility.are_allowed
    True
    >>> view.visible_email_address_description
    'This email address is not disclosed to others.'
    >>> view.visible_email_addresses
    [u'test@canonical.com', u'testing@canonical.com']

    >>> login('commercial-member@canonical.com')
    >>> view = create_initialized_view(sample_person, '+index')
    >>> view.email_address_visibility.are_allowed
    True
    >>> view.visible_email_addresses
    [u'test@canonical.com', u'testing@canonical.com']

Teams are like Persons. No email address is disclosed when the user is
anonymous.

    >>> login(ANONYMOUS)
    >>> ubuntu_team = person_set.getByName('ubuntu-team')
    >>> view = create_initialized_view(ubuntu_team, '+index')
    >>> view.email_address_visibility.is_login_required
    True
    >>> view.visible_email_addresses
    []

A logged in user can see the team's contact address because it cannot
be hidden.

    >>> login('no-priv@canonical.com')
    >>> view = create_initialized_view(ubuntu_team, '+index')
    >>> view.email_address_visibility.are_public
    True
    >>> view.visible_email_addresses
    [u'support@ubuntu.com']

When the user or team does not have a validated contact address, the
email addresses state is NONE_AVAILABLE.

    >>> landscape_developers = person_set.getByName('landscape-developers')
    >>> view = create_initialized_view(landscape_developers, '+index')
    >>> view.email_address_visibility.are_none_available
    True
    >>> print view.visible_email_address_description
    None
    >>> view.visible_email_addresses
    []


== Things a person is working on ==

PersonView is the base for many views for Person objects. It provides
several properties to help display things the user is working on.

The +portlet-currentfocus view is responsible for rendering the
"Working on..." section in the Person profile page (+index). Nothing
is rendered when the user does not have any assigned bug or specs
that are not in progress.

    >>> user = factory.makePerson(name='ken', password='test')
    >>> view = create_initialized_view(user, name='+portlet-currentfocus')
    >>> view.has_assigned_bugs_or_specs_in_progress
    False
    >>> view.assigned_bugs_in_progress.count()
    0
    >>> view.assigned_specs_in_progress.count()
    0
    >>> print view.render()
    <BLANKLINE>

Assigned specifications that do not display when they are not in an
in progress state.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import (
    ... SpecificationImplementationStatus)

    >>> login(user.preferredemail.email)
    >>> product = factory.makeProduct(name="tool", owner=user)
    >>> spec = factory.makeSpecification(
    ...     product=product, title='Specs need stories')
    >>> spec.assignee = user
    >>> view.has_assigned_bugs_or_specs_in_progress
    False
    >>> view.assigned_bugs_in_progress.count()
    0
    >>> view.assigned_specs_in_progress.count()
    0

The specification is displayed only when it is in a in progress state
(The state may be any from STARTED though DEPLOYMENT). Below the
list of specifications is a link to show all the specifications that
the user is working on.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import (
    ... SpecificationDefinitionStatus)

    >>> spec.definition_status = SpecificationDefinitionStatus.APPROVED
    >>> newstate = spec.updateLifecycleStatus(user)
    >>> spec.implementation_status = SpecificationImplementationStatus.STARTED
    >>> newstate = spec.updateLifecycleStatus(user)
    >>> view = create_initialized_view(user, name='+portlet-currentfocus')
    >>> view.has_assigned_bugs_or_specs_in_progress
    True
    >>> view.assigned_bugs_in_progress.count()
    0
    >>> view.assigned_specs_in_progress.count()
    1
    >>> print view.render()
    <div id="working-on">...
    ...<a href="http://blueprints.launchpad.dev/tool/+spec/..."...>Specs
      need stories</a>...
    <a href="/~ken/+specs?role=assignee">
      &raquo; Show all assigned blueprints </a>...
    </div>...

Assigned bugs do not display when their status is not INPROGRESS.

    >>> bug = factory.makeBug(
    ...     product=product, title='tool does not work')
    >>> bug.bugtasks[0].transitionToAssignee(user)
    >>> view.has_assigned_bugs_or_specs_in_progress
    True
    >>> view.assigned_bugs_in_progress.count()
    0
    >>> view.assigned_specs_in_progress.count()
    1

The assigned bug is displayed in the "Working on..." section when
its status is in INPROGRESS.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import BugTaskStatus

    >>> bug.bugtasks[0].transitionToStatus(BugTaskStatus.INPROGRESS, user)
    >>> view.has_assigned_bugs_or_specs_in_progress
    True
    >>> view.assigned_bugs_in_progress.count()
    1
    >>> view.assigned_specs_in_progress.count()
    1
    >>> print view.render()
    <div id="working-on">...
    ...<a href="http://bugs.launchpad.dev/tool/+bug/..."...>tool
      does not work</a>...
    <a href="http://launchpad.dev/~ken/+assignedbugs?...">
      &raquo; Show all bugs in progress </a>...
    ...<a href="http://blueprints.launchpad.dev/tool/+spec/..."...>Specs
      need stories</a>...
    <a href="/~ken/+specs?role=assignee">
      &raquo; Show all assigned blueprints </a>...
    </div>...

Multiple bugs and specs are displayed.

    >>> another_bug = factory.makeBug(
    ...     product=product, title='tool does is broken')
    >>> another_bug.bugtasks[0].transitionToAssignee(user)
    >>> another_bug.bugtasks[0].transitionToStatus(
    ...     BugTaskStatus.INPROGRESS, user)
    >>> view.has_assigned_bugs_or_specs_in_progress
    True
    >>> view.assigned_bugs_in_progress.count()
    2
    >>> view.assigned_specs_in_progress.count()
    1

But duplicate bugs are never displayed.

    >>> another_bug.duplicateof = bug

    >>> view.has_assigned_bugs_or_specs_in_progress
    True
    >>> view.assigned_bugs_in_progress.count()
    1
    >>> view.assigned_specs_in_progress.count()
    1


== Person Packages ==

The page at ~user/+packages contains three sections,
"Maintained Packages", "Uploaded Packages" and "PPA Packages".

Each section is limited to displaying at most 30 packages so that
the page does not time out before Zope can render it.

Before continuing, create lots of packages that will appear in each
section of Foo Bar's +packages page, such that there's more available
that we're willing to display.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces.distribution import (
    ...     IDistributionSet)
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces.publishing import (
    ...     PackagePublishingStatus)
    >>> name16 = person_set.getByName('name16')
    >>> sabdfl = person_set.getByName('sabdfl')
    >>> ubuntu = getUtility(IDistributionSet)['ubuntu']
    >>> warty = ubuntu['warty']
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.tests.test_publishing import (
    ...     SoyuzTestPublisher)
    >>> test_pub = SoyuzTestPublisher()
    >>> test_pub.person = name16

    >>> view = create_initialized_view(name16, '+related-software')
    >>> for count in range(0, view.SUMMARY_PAGE_PACKAGE_LIMIT + 3):
    ...     source_name = "foo" + str(count)
    ...     # Add the PPA packages.
    ...     discard = test_pub.getPubSource(
    ...         sourcename=source_name,
    ...         status=PackagePublishingStatus.PUBLISHED,
    ...         archive=sabdfl.archive,
    ...         distroseries=warty)
    ...     # Add the maintained packages.
    ...     discard = test_pub.getPubSource(
    ...         sourcename=source_name,
    ...         status=PackagePublishingStatus.PUBLISHED,
    ...         distroseries=warty)
    ...     # Add the uploaded packages.
    ...     discard = test_pub.getPubSource(
    ...         maintainer=sabdfl,
    ...         sourcename=source_name,
    ...         status=PackagePublishingStatus.PUBLISHED,
    ...         distroseries=warty)
    >>> import transaction
    >>> transaction.commit()

There are many more new packages to be displayed on the page now:

    >>> name16.getLatestUploadedPPAPackages().count() > 30
    True

    >>> name16.getLatestMaintainedPackages().count() > 30
    True

    >>> name16.getLatestUploadedButNotMaintainedPackages().count() > 30
    True

The view enforces the limit.

    >>> len(view.get_latest_uploaded_ppa_packages_with_stats)
    30

    >>> len(view.get_latest_maintained_packages_with_stats)
    30

    >>> len(view.get_latest_uploaded_but_not_maintained_packages_with_stats)
    30

The view has a helper method that returns a message that can be used
at the head of each table.

    >>> view._tableHeaderMessage(100)
    'Displaying first 30 packages out of 100 total'

    >>> view._tableHeaderMessage(30)
    '30 packages'

    >>> view._tableHeaderMessage(1)
    '1 package'


== Contacting the person ==

For consistency and testing purposes, the "+contactuser" page is available
even when someone is looking at their own profile page.  The wording on the
tooltip is different though.

    >>> login('no-priv@canonical.com')
    >>> view = create_initialized_view(mark, '+index')
    >>> print view.contact_link_title
    Send an email to this user through Launchpad

    >>> no_priv = person_set.getByEmail('no-priv@canonical.com')
    >>> view = create_initialized_view(no_priv, '+index')
    >>> print view.contact_link_title
    Send an email to yourself through Launchpad

This is true even when the user is hiding their email addresses.

    >>> name12 = person_set.getByName('name12')
    >>> view = create_initialized_view(name12, '+index')
    >>> print view.contact_link_title
    Send an email to this user through Launchpad

    >>> login('test@canonical.com')
    >>> view = create_initialized_view(name12, '+index')
    >>> print view.contact_link_title
    Send an email to yourself through Launchpad
