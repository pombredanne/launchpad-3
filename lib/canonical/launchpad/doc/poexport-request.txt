Rosetta PO Export Request Queue
-------------------------------

The queue of export requests is served by a cron script. Let's check if it can
serve those requests properly.

This is a dummy logger class to capture the export's log messages.

    >>> import sys
    >>> import traceback

    >>> class MockLogger:
    ...     messages = []
    ...
    ...     def log(self, *stuff, **kw):
    ...         print 'log>', ' '.join(stuff)
    ...
    ...         if 'exc_info' in kw:
    ...             exception = traceback.format_exception(*sys.exc_info())
    ...             for thing in exception:
    ...                 for line in thing.splitlines():
    ...                     self.log(line)
    ...
    ...     debug = info = warn = error = log
    ...
    ...     def exception(self, *stuff):
    ...         self.log(*stuff, **{'exc_info': True})

Here's somebody to make a request.

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import Person
  >>> person = Person.get(1)

Here's the stuff they're going to request.

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import POTemplate
  >>> potemplate = POTemplate.get(2)
  >>> ca = potemplate.getPOFileByLang('ca')
  >>> cs = potemplate.getPOFileByLang('cs')

And here's them making the request.

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import POExportRequestSet
  >>> request_set = POExportRequestSet()
  >>> request_set.addRequest(person, None, [ca, cs])

Now we request that the queue be processed.

  >>> class MockTransactionManager:
  ...     def commit(self):
  ...         pass

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.scripts.po_export_queue import process_queue
  >>> process_queue(MockTransactionManager(), MockLogger())
  log> Exporting objects for person 1, PO template 2

We need to make sure the Librarian data has settled into place.

  >>> import transaction
  >>> transaction.commit()

Let's read our mail.

  >>> def print_mail_body(body):
  ...     lines = body[body.index('\n\n')+2:].split('\n')
  ...     for line in lines:
  ...         print ">", line

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.mail.stub import test_emails
  >>> len(test_emails)
  1
  >>> from_addr, to_addrs, body = test_emails[0]
  >>> from_addr
  'bounces@canonical.com'
  >>> to_addrs
  ['mark@hbd.com']
  >>> print_mail_body(body)
  > 
  > Hello Mark Shuttleworth,
  > 
  > The files you requested from Rosetta are ready for download
  > from the following location:
  > 
  >     http://localhost:58000/.../rosetta-pmount.tar.gz

The mail has a URL in it.

  >>> import re

  >>> def extract_url(text):
  ...     urls = re.compile(r'^ *(http://.*)$', re.M).findall(text)
  ...     return urls[0]

  >>> url = extract_url(body)

Let's download it and make sure the contents look ok.

  >>> import urllib2
  >>> from canonical.launchpad.helpers import string_to_tarfile
  >>> tarball = string_to_tarfile(urllib2.urlopen(url).read())
  >>> for name in sorted(tarball.getnames()):
  ...   print name
  rosetta-pmount/
  rosetta-pmount/ca.po
  rosetta-pmount/cs.po

Now let's see what happens if one of the PO files is broken.

  >>> hr = potemplate.getPOFileByLang('hr')
  >>> hr.header = 'Content-Type: text/plain; charset=broken\n'
  >>> hr.sync()
  >>> hr.export()
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
  POInvalidInputError: Unknown charset u'broken'

  >>> test_emails[:] = []
  >>> request_set.addRequest(person, None, [hr, ca])
  >>> process_queue(MockTransactionManager(), MockLogger())
  log> Exporting objects for person 1, PO template 2

  >>> transaction.commit()

We should have two extra emails, one to the error reports mailing list and
another to the person who made the request.

  >>> len(test_emails)
  2
  >>> from_addr, to_addrs1, body = test_emails[0]
  >>> from_addr, to_addrs2, body = test_emails[1]
  >>> sorted(to_addrs1 + to_addrs2)
  ['launchpad-error-reports@lists.canonical.com', 'mark@hbd.com']
  >>> print_mail_body(body)
  > 
  > Hello Mark Shuttleworth,
  > 
  > Rosetta has finished exporting your requested files.
  > However, problems were encountered exporting the
  > following files:
  >

We should get a slightly different email if we didn't manage to export any
files:

  >>> test_emails[:] = []
  >>> request_set.addRequest(person, None, [hr])
  >>> process_queue(MockTransactionManager(), MockLogger())
  log> Exporting objects for person 1, PO template 2

  >>> transaction.commit()

  >>> len(test_emails)
  2
  >>> from_addr, to_addrs, body = test_emails[0]
  >>> print_mail_body(body)
  > 
  > Hello Mark Shuttleworth,
  > 
  > Rosetta encountered problems exporting the files you
  > requested. The Rosetta team has been notified of this
  > problem. Please reply to this email for further assistance.

Let's try requesting an export in MO format:

  >>> from canonical.lp.dbschema import RosettaFileFormat
  >>> test_emails[:] = []
  >>> request_set.addRequest(person, None, [ca], RosettaFileFormat.MO)
  >>> process_queue(MockTransactionManager(), MockLogger())
  log> Exporting objects for person 1, PO template 2

  >>> transaction.commit()

  >>> len(test_emails)
  1
  >>> from_addr, to_addrs, body = test_emails[0]
  >>> url = extract_url(body)

We will need to define a helper function.

  >>> def is_valid_mofile(mofile):
  ...     """Test whether a string is a valid MO file."""
  ...
  ...     # There are different magics for big- and little-endianness, so we
  ...     # test for both.
  ...     be_magic = '\x95\x04\x12\xde'
  ...     le_magic = ''.join(reversed(be_magic))
  ...
  ...     for magic in (be_magic, le_magic):
  ...         if mofile[:len(magic)] == magic:
  ...             return True
  ...
  ...     return False

  >>> is_valid_mofile(urllib2.urlopen(url).read())
  True

Let's test the .mo compilation.

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.components.poexport import MOCompiler
  >>> compiler = MOCompiler()

  >>> mofile = compiler.compile('''
  ... msgid "foo"
  ... msgstr "bar"
  ... ''')
  >>> is_valid_mofile(mofile)
  True

  >>> mofile = compiler.compile('''
  ... blah
  ... ''')
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
  MOCompilationError: ...

Finally, test running the script directly to be sure the user has the correct
rights.
We need to request again some files:

  >>> request_set = POExportRequestSet()
  >>> request_set.addRequest(person, None, [ca, cs])
  >>> transaction.commit()

And run the script.

  >>> import subprocess
  >>> import sys
  >>> process = subprocess.Popen([
  ...     sys.executable, 'cronscripts/rosetta-export-queue.py', '-vv'
  ...     ], stdin=subprocess.PIPE, stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
  ...     stderr=subprocess.STDOUT
  ...     )
  >>> (output, empty) = process.communicate()
  >>> print output
  INFO    creating lockfile
  DEBUG   Exporting objects for person 1, PO template 2
  DEBUG   Removing lock file: /var/lock/launchpad-rosetta-export-queue.lock
