= Badges =

Badges are nifty user interface elements that are used to indicate to
the user that there are interesting features about the thing that the
badges are attached to, for example a bug can have a badge to indicate
that there is a related branch.

Badges are shown in two main places:
  * Object listings
  * Main object pages

In the object listing views, badges are used to show links between
objects, such as bug-branch links or bug-spec links, and object
attribute values such as privacy or mentoring availability.

Listings use small icon sized images, and object details pages use
larger logo sized images.

In order to maintain a level of standardisation across the badge uses in
Launchpad, there is a central list of standard badges along with their
alternate text and titles.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.webapp.badge import STANDARD_BADGES

Iterating over this collection gives:

    >>> for name in sorted(STANDARD_BADGES.keys()):
    ...     print name
    blueprint
    branch
    bug
    private


== The Badge class ==

The badge class has two methods of interest:
  * renderIconImage - the HTML for the icon sized image
  * renderHeadingImage - the HTML for the logo sized image

A badge is constructed with the locations of the images, the default
alternate text and the default title.  An optional id attribute for a
Badge is added to the rendered heading image.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.webapp.badge import Badge
    >>> bug = Badge(
    ...     icon_image='/@@/bug', heading_image='/@@/bug-large',
    ...     alt='bug', title='Linked to a bug', id='bugbadge')

Both `alt` and `title` default to the empty string.

Calling the render methods will produce the default image HTML.

    >>> print bug.renderIconImage()
    <img alt="bug" width="14" height="14" src="/@@/bug"
         title="Linked to a bug"/>
    >>> print bug.renderHeadingImage()
    <img alt="bug" width="32" height="32" src="/@@/bug-large"
         title="Linked to a bug" id="bugbadge"/>

If the icon_image or heading_image are not specified, then the rendering
the particular size results in the empty string.

    >>> no_large = Badge(icon_image='/@@/bug')
    >>> no_large.renderHeadingImage()
    ''
    >>> no_small = Badge(heading_image='/@@/bug')
    >>> no_small.renderIconImage()
    ''


== IHasBadges ==

How to determine which badges to show for a given object is defined by
the IHasBadges interface.

The base badge implementation class, `HasBadgeBase`, provides an
implementation of IHasBadges.

Classes that derive from HasBadgeBase need to define a sequence attribute
called `badges` that list the names of possible badges.  These names
are then expanded into method calls to determine the visibility of that
badge.  For example a badge called `bug` will expand to a method call
`isBugBadgeVisible`.

In order to provide a badge that is not one of the standard ones, the
badger class needs to implement the method `getBadge`.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.webapp.badge import HasBadgeBase
    >>> class SimpleBadger(HasBadgeBase):
    ...     badges = ["bug", "fish"]
    ...     def isBugBadgeVisible(self):
    ...         return False
    ...     def isFishBadgeVisible(self):
    ...         return True
    ...     def getBadge(self, badge_name):
    ...         if badge_name == "fish":
    ...             return Badge('small-fish', 'large-fish', 'fish')
    ...         else:
    ...             return HasBadgeBase.getBadge(self, badge_name)

    >>> for badge in SimpleBadger().getVisibleBadges():
    ...     print badge.alt
    fish

If the class does not implement the approprate method you get a
NotImplementedError.

    >>> SimpleBadger.badges.append("blueprint")
    >>> for badge in SimpleBadger().getVisibleBadges():
    ...     print badge.alt
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    NotImplementedError: isBlueprintBadgeVisible


== Preferred badging methodology ==

Under normal circumstances the badges for a given content object require
the accessing or counting of attributes and this almost always requires
database queries.  While this is fine for a single object, we do not
want to have this happen for listings of objects.  For example, if there
were 5 possible badges for a branch and 3 of those counted links to
other tables, and we had a listing of 75 branches, then that is 225
database queries just for the badges.

In order to allow efficient database queries for listings, the suggested
badging methodology is to provide an adapter for the content class to
adapt the content class to `IHasBadges`.  The implementation of this
adapter can do the simple determination of a badge based on the
accessing or counting of the content object's attributes.  The listing
views then use a decorated object in order to override the badge
determination methods to use the results of an alternative query.

    >>> from zope.interface import Interface, Attribute
    >>> class IFoo(Interface):
    ...     bugs = Attribute('Some linked bugs')
    ...     blueprints = Attribute('Some linked blueprints')

    >>> from zope.interface import implements
    >>> class Foo(object):
    ...     implements(IFoo)
    ...     @property
    ...     def bugs(self):
    ...         print "Foo.bugs"
    ...         return ['a']
    ...     @property
    ...     def blueprints(self):
    ...         print "Foo.blueprints"
    ...         return []

Now define the adapter for the Foo content class.

    >>> class FooBadges(HasBadgeBase):
    ...     badges = "bug", "blueprint"
    ...     def __init__(self, context):
    ...         self.context = context
    ...     def isBugBadgeVisible(self):
    ...         return len(self.context.bugs) > 0
    ...     def isBlueprintBadgeVisible(self):
    ...         return len(self.context.blueprints) > 0

Usually, one would register an adapter in ZCML from the content type to
IHasBadges.  Here is the sample from the branch.zcml to illustrate.

  <adapter
      for="canonical.launchpad.interfaces.IBranch"
      provides="canonical.launchpad.webapp.badge.IHasBadges"
      factory="canonical.launchpad.browser.BranchBadges"
      />

Luckily zope provides a way to do this in doctests:

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.webapp.badge import IHasBadges
    >>> from zope.app.testing import ztapi
    >>> ztapi.provideAdapter(Foo, IHasBadges, FooBadges)

Now adapting a Foo to IHasBadges should provide an instance of FooBadges.

    >>> foo = Foo()
    >>> foo
    <Foo object at ...>

    >>> badger = IHasBadges(foo)
    >>> badger
    <FooBadges object at ...>

Getting the visible badges for foo calls the underlying methods on foo,
as illustrated by the printed method calls.

    >>> for badge in badger.getVisibleBadges():
    ...     print badge.renderIconImage()
    Foo.bugs
    Foo.blueprints
    <img alt="bug" width="14" height="14" src="/@@/bug" title="Linked to a bug"/>

When showing listings of Foos, you often want to decorate them with
`canonical.lp.decorates`.  By having the DecoratedFoo inherit from the
FooBadges class, we provide two things: a default implementation for
each of the badge methods; and direct implementation of IHasBadges.
This allows the decorated class to provide an alternative method to
decide on badge visibility.  For example, with branches the visibility
of the bug badge is determined by the users ability to see the bugs for
any bug branch links. On listings we don't want to do 100 queries
just to check bug badges. The batch handler for branches executes a
single query for the BugBranch links for the branches in the batch and
that is used to contruct the DecoratedBranch.

    >>> from canonical.lp import decorates
    >>> class DecoratedFoo(FooBadges):
    ...     decorates(IFoo, 'foo')
    ...     def __init__(self, foo):
    ...         FooBadges.__init__(self, foo)
    ...         self.foo = foo
    ...     def isBugBadgeVisible(self):
    ...         return True
    ...     def isBlueprintBadgeVisible(self):
    ...         return False

    >>> decorated_foo = DecoratedFoo(foo)
    >>> decorated_foo
    <DecoratedFoo object at ...>

Since the DecoratedFoo implements IHasBadges through the class hierarchy
FooBadges and then HasBadgeBase, getting an IHasBadges for the
DecoratedFoo returns the same object.

    >>> badger = IHasBadges(decorated_foo)
    >>> badger is decorated_foo
    True

Getting the visible badges for the decorated_foo bypasses the underlying
method calls, and thus avoiding unnecessary database hits (for normal
content classes).

    >>> for badge in badger.getVisibleBadges():
    ...     print badge.renderIconImage()
    <img alt="bug" width="14" height="14" src="/@@/bug" title="Linked to a bug"/>


== Tales expressions ==

There is a tales formatter defined for badges.  These can be shown
as either small or large.

Using the tales formatter on the context object itself ends up using the
adapter that is defined for the content class, and as shown below
through the printed attribute accessors, uses the attributes of the
content class.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests import test_tales
    >>> print test_tales('context/badges:small', context=foo)
    Foo.bugs
    Foo.blueprints
    <img alt="bug" width="14" height="14" src="/@@/bug"
         title="Linked to a bug"/>

    >>> print test_tales('context/badges:large', context=foo)
    Foo.bugs
    Foo.blueprints
    <img alt="bug" width="32" height="32" src="/@@/bug-large"
         title="Linked to a bug" id="bugbadge"/>

Using the decorated foo, we get the decorated methods called and avoid
the content class method calls.

    >>> print test_tales('context/badges:small', context=decorated_foo)
    <img alt="bug" width="14" height="14" src="/@@/bug"
         title="Linked to a bug"/>
    >>> print test_tales('context/badges:large', context=decorated_foo)
    <img alt="bug" width="32" height="32" src="/@@/bug-large"
         title="Linked to a bug" id="bugbadge"/>
