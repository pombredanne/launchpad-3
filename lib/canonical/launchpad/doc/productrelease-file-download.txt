ProductRelease File Download
============================

A ProductRelease can have files associated with it for one of two
reasons.  First, a code tarball can be associated to a ProductRelease
and it is used to create an associated branch.

In another use, a product owner can associate files with a
ProductRelease for direct download by Launchpad users.  These files
can be installers, executables, documentation, or README files.

A ProductSeries can have multiple releases.  Firefox 1.5 (a ProductSeries)
has ProductReleases 1.5.0.1 and 1.5.0.2
    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.webapp.testing import verifyObject
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import (
    ...     IPersonSet, IProductSeries, IProductSet, NotFoundError, IProjectSet)
    >>> from canonical.database.sqlbase import flush_database_updates

First, get a product that has some ProductSeries in the sample data.

    >>> productset = getUtility(IProductSet)
    >>> firefox = productset['firefox']

A ProductSeries can be retrieved using the associated product and the
series name.

    >>> trunk = firefox.getSeries('trunk')

Get the product releases for trunk.

    >>> releases = trunk.releases
    >>> releases.count()
    3

Find all product release files for trunk.
    >>> files = trunk.release_files
    >>> len(files)
    1

Pick the first release from the set.
    >>> rel = releases[0]
    >>> files = rel.files
    >>> print files.count()
    1

Add a file alias to the productrelease.
    >>> from StringIO import StringIO
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import (
    ...     IBugAttachmentSet, IMessageSet, IBugMessageSet,
    ...     ILibraryFileAliasSet)
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import ILaunchBag

    >>> def current_user():
    ...     return getUtility(ILaunchBag).user

    >>> login("foo.bar@canonical.com")
    >>> file_content = 'Some useful information.'
    >>> file_alias = getUtility(ILibraryFileAliasSet).create(
    ...     name='foo.txt', size=len(file_content),
    ...     file=StringIO(file_content), contentType='text/plain')
    >>> product_release_file = rel.addFileAlias(file_alias,
    ...     signature=None,
    ...     uploader=current_user(),
    ...     description="Foo file")

Ensure the description is as we set it.
    >>> print product_release_file.description
    Foo file

And that the number of files in the ProductRelease has increased.
    >>> print rel.files.count()
    2

And that the number of files on the series has increased
    >>> print len(trunk.release_files)
    2
    
Retrieve the alias by name.
    >>> file_alias = rel.getFileAliasByName('foo.txt')
    >>> print file_alias.filename
    foo.txt

Retrieve an alias that does not exist and see that an error is raised.
    >>> file_alias = rel.getFileAliasByName('bar.txt')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    NotFoundError: 'bar.txt'

Delete the file alias from the ProductRelease and see the file count decrement.
    >>> rel.deleteFileAlias(file_alias)
    >>> print rel.files.count()
    1

Try to delete the same alias again and see that an error is raised.
    >>> rel.deleteFileAlias(file_alias)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    NotFoundError: u'foo.txt'

Attempting to delete files via a GET method are not allowed.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.webapp.servers import LaunchpadTestRequest
    >>> from zope.component import getMultiAdapter
    >>> request = LaunchpadTestRequest(
    ...     environ={'REQUEST_METHOD': 'GET'},
    ...     form={'delete_files': 'Delete Files'})
    >>> firefox = getUtility(IProductSet).getByName('firefox')
    >>> view = getMultiAdapter((firefox,request), name='+download')
    >>> view.initialize()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
     ...
    UnsafeFormGetSubmissionError: Delete Files

Determine which (series,release) pairs are associated with milestones.

    >>> trunk = firefox.getSeries('trunk')
    >>> ms = trunk.newMilestone('0.9.2')
    >>> release = trunk.getRelease('0.9.2')
    >>> request = LaunchpadTestRequest(
    ...     environ={'REQUEST_METHOD': 'GET'},
    ...     form=dict())
    >>> view = getMultiAdapter((firefox,request), name='+download')
    >>> view.initialize()
    >>> print view.is_milestone(trunk, release)
    True
