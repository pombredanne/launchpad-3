Distro Arch Releases can tell you about their published releases.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Distro Arch Releases have a number of releases of any given binary
package in them. This can be due to various reasons such as uploads in
progress, superseding in progress, or simply that there is more than
one version spread across the pockets. getReleasedPackages lets us
interrogate this information.

   >>> for p in hoary_i386.getReleasedPackages("pmount"):
   ...     print p.binarypackagerelease.binarypackagename.name
   pmount


DistroArchSeries class has a built-in method to return a single 
dependency package candidate by its name as a PublishedPackage 
instance:

   >>> hoary_i386.findDepCandidateByName("pmount").binarypackagename
   u'pmount'

Since 'at' isn't available in our sampledata (not even published), 
None is returned:

   >>> hoary_i386.findDepCandidateByName("at") is None
   True

Check the behaviour of the provided search method, which returns a
list of IDARBPR instances containing the matching packages.

   >>> results = hoary_i386.searchBinaryPackages(text='pmount')
   >>> len(results)
   1
   >>> pmount = results[0]

The method works even when we are searching for packages whose names are
not fti-matchable, such as "linux-2.6.12", and substrings:

   >>> warty_i386 = DistroArchSeries.get(1)
   >>> results = warty_i386.searchBinaryPackages(text='linux-2.6.12')
   >>> len(results)
   1
   >>> results = hoary_i386.searchBinaryPackages(text='moun')
   >>> len(results)
   1

   # XXX cprov 2006-03-21: Broken implementation, missing lastversions
   # attribute.
   verifyObject(IDistroArchSeriesBinaryPackageRelease, pmount)
   True

Check IDARBP provider

   >>> pmount_hoary_i386 = hoary_i386.getBinaryPackage('pmount')

   >>> verifyObject(IDistroArchSeriesBinaryPackage, pmount_hoary_i386)
   True

   >>> pmount_hoary_i386.name
   u'pmount'


Check some properties of DARBP meta class

Entire publishing history:

   >>> pmount_hoary_i386.publishing_history.count()
   2

Most recent published history row:

   >>> bpph = pmount_hoary_i386.current_published

   # XXX cprov 2006-03-22: The object doesn't pass verifyObject()
   # due the lack of distroarchseriesbinarypackagerelease attribute.

   >>> IBinaryPackagePublishingHistory.providedBy(bpph)
   True

   >>> bpph.section.name
   u'editors'

Perform `post publication` override:

   >>> new_section = getUtility(ISectionSet)['base']
   >>> version = bpph.binarypackagerelease.version
   >>> pmount_hoary_i386_released = pmount_hoary_i386[version]

   >>> pmount_hoary_i386_released.current_publishing_record.changeOverride(
   ...     new_section=new_section)
   >>> pub_hist = pmount_hoary_i386.publishing_history
   >>> pub_hist.count()
   3

Override information about 'pmount' is pending publication:

   >>> pub_hist[0].status.name, pub_hist[0].section.name
   ('PENDING', u'base')

Supersede current publication:

   >>> pmount_pubrec = pmount_hoary_i386_released.current_publishing_record
   >>> superseded_pmount = pmount_pubrec.supersede()
   >>> pmount_hoary_i386.publishing_history.count()
   3

   >>> superseded_pmount.status.name, superseded_pmount.datesuperseded
   ('SUPERSEDED', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP AT TIME ZONE 'UTC')
