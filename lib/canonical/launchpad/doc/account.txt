======================
Account and AccountSet
======================

An Account is used by someone to Authenticate with the Launchpad login
service.


AccountSet
==========

The AccountSet object provides methods to retrieve `IAccount`s. It
implements the IAccountSet interface.

    >>> from zope.interface.verify import verifyObject
    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.person import IPerson
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces.account import (
    ...     IAccount, IAccountSet)

    >>> account_set = getUtility(IAccountSet)
    >>> verifyObject(IAccountSet, account_set)
    True


Looking up accounts by email address
------------------------------------

Accounts are generally looked up by email address.

    >>> login('no-priv@canonical.com')
    >>> account = account_set.getByEmail('no-priv@canonical.com')
    >>> IAccount.providedBy(account)
    True

If the account is not found, a LookupError is raised.

    >>> account_set.getByEmail('invalid@whatever')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    LookupError:...

Only admins or the person attached to an account can see or edit Account
details. This is obviously wrong, as the account should have access
rather than the (optional) attached person. In particular, it means
Accounts without Person records cannot be managed by the Account owner.
Fixing this involves more surgery to Launchpad's security systems.

    >>> stub_account = account_set.getByEmail('stuart.bishop@canonical.com')
    >>> stub_account.date_created
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    Unauthorized...

    >>> del stub_account


Looking up accounts by their database ID
----------------------------------------

If we know the ID of an account we can use the get() method.

    >>> account_set.get(account.id) == account
    True

If there's no account with the given ID, a LookupError is raised.

    >>> account_set.get(99999)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    LookupError:...


Looking up accounts by OpenID identifier
----------------------------------------

Each Launchpad user is assigned an permanent OpenID identity URL. The
last component of this URL is specific to the user, and can be used to
look up the user.

    >>> account = account_set.getByOpenIDIdentifier(u'no-priv_oid')
    >>> IAccount.providedBy(account)
    True
    >>> print account.displayname
    No Privileges Person

A LookupError is raised if the identifier is not used by any account.

    >>> account_set.getByOpenIDIdentifier(u'no-such-identifier')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    LookupError: no-such-identifier


The Account object
==================

The account implements the IAccount interface but not all attributes are
accessible for the owner.

    >>> login('admin@canonical.com')
    >>> verifyObject(IAccount, account)
    True
    >>> login('no-priv@canonical.com')

An account has a displayname, and a preferred email address.

    >>> print account.displayname
    No Privileges Person
    >>> print account.preferredemail.email
    no-priv@canonical.com

Account objects have a useful string representation.

    >>> account
    <Account 'No Privileges Person' (Active account)>

The account can have additional validated and guessed email
addresses.  This will be empty if the user has only a single validated
email address.

    >>> [email.email for email in account.validated_emails]
    []
    >>> [email.email for email in account.guessed_emails]
    []

If we add a new guessed email address, it will be included in the
guessed list.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces.emailaddress import (
    ...     EmailAddressStatus,
    ...     IEmailAddressSet,
    ...     )
    >>> email = getUtility(IEmailAddressSet).new(
    ...     "guessed-email@example.com", account=account,
    ...     status=EmailAddressStatus.NEW)
    >>> [email.email for email in account.guessed_emails]
    [u'guessed-email@example.com']

If we add a validated email address, it will show up in the validated
list.

    >>> email = getUtility(IEmailAddressSet).new(
    ...     "validated-email@example.com", account=account,
    ...     status=EmailAddressStatus.VALIDATED)
    >>> [email.email for email in account.validated_emails]
    [u'validated-email@example.com']

It also has an encrypted password.

    >>> print account.password
    K7Qmeansl6RbuPfulfcmyDQOzp70OxVh5Fcf

Ensure the password changes are sticky, as this is a property hiding the
AccountPassword table.

    >>> account.password = None
    >>> print account.password
    None

    >>> account.password = u'K7Qmeansl6RbuPfulfcmyDQOzp70OxVh5Fcf'
    >>> print account.password
    K7Qmeansl6RbuPfulfcmyDQOzp70OxVh5Fcf

The account has other metadata.

    >>> account.date_created
    datetime.datetime(...)

    >>> print account.creation_rationale.name
    OWNER_CREATED_LAUNCHPAD

    >>> print account.status.name
    ACTIVE

    >>> account.date_status_set >= account.date_created
    True

    >>> print account.status_comment
    None

    >>> print account.displayname
    No Privileges Person

When the status is changed, the date_status_set is updated in the
database. Only an admin can change the status.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces.account import AccountStatus

    >>> original_date_status_set = account.date_status_set
    >>> login('admin@canonical.com')
    >>> account.status = AccountStatus.SUSPENDED

    # Shouldn't be necessary with Storm!
    >>> from zope.security.proxy import removeSecurityProxy
    >>> removeSecurityProxy(account).sync()
    >>> account.date_status_set > original_date_status_set
    True

    >>> account.status = AccountStatus.ACTIVE
    >>> login('no-priv@canonical.com')

An Account has at least one OpenID identifier used to generate the
OpenID identity URL.

    >>> account.openid_identifiers.any().identifier
    u'no-priv_oid'


Creating new accounts
=====================

New Accounts are created using the AccountSet.new() method. The account
rationale and displayname are required.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces.account import (
    ...     AccountCreationRationale)
    >>> from storm.store import Store

    >>> login('admin@canonical.com')
    >>> passwordless_account = account_set.new(
    ...     AccountCreationRationale.USER_CREATED, 'Passwordless')
    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> print passwordless_account.creation_rationale.name
    USER_CREATED
    >>> print passwordless_account.displayname
    Passwordless
    >>> print passwordless_account.password
    None
    >>> print passwordless_account.preferredemail
    None

The new() method accepts the optional parameters of password and
password_is_encrypted. If password_is_encrypted is False, the default,
then the method encrypts it for us.

    >>> passworded_account = account_set.new(
    ...     AccountCreationRationale.OWNER_CREATED_LAUNCHPAD , 'Passworded',
    ...     password=u'clear_password')
    >>> Store.of(passworded_account).flush()
    >>> passworded_account.password == u'clear_password'
    False

The method does not encrypt the password if told that it is already
encrypted, by setting password_is_encrypted to True.

    >>> clear_account = account_set.new(
    ...     AccountCreationRationale.OWNER_CREATED_LAUNCHPAD , 'Clear',
    ...     password=u'clear_password', password_is_encrypted=True)
    >>> Store.of(clear_account).flush()
    >>> print clear_account.password
    clear_password


Valid Accounts
--------------

Like person objects, an account is considered valid if it is in the
active state and has a preferred email address.  So a newly created
account with no email address is not valid.

    >>> account = account_set.new(
    ...     AccountCreationRationale.USER_CREATED,
    ...     "Valid Account Test")
    >>> account.status = AccountStatus.ACTIVE
    >>> account.is_valid
    False

Let's add a new email address to the account.

    >>> email = getUtility(IEmailAddressSet).new(
    ...     "valid-account-test@example.com", account=account)
    >>> account.is_valid
    False

The account is still not valid because it has no preferred email.
Setting the email to preferred fixes this.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces.emailaddress import EmailAddressStatus
    >>> email.status = EmailAddressStatus.PREFERRED
    >>> account.is_valid
    True

If the account is deactivated, it won't be considered valid any more:

    >>> account.status = AccountStatus.DEACTIVATED
    >>> account.is_valid
    False


Creating an IPerson for an Account
----------------------------------

Newly created accounts without an associated Person can be 'promoted' to full
Launchpad accounts with an attached Person.

    # We need to change database policy here again, as the SSO Server cannot
    # modify tables in the lpmain replication set.
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.webapp.dbpolicy import MasterDatabasePolicy
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.webapp.interfaces import IStoreSelector
    >>> getUtility(IStoreSelector).push(MasterDatabasePolicy())

    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.person import PersonCreationRationale
    >>> fresh_account, email = account_set.createAccountAndEmail(
    ...     'foo@example.com',
    ...     AccountCreationRationale.OWNER_CREATED_UBUNTU_SHOP,
    ...     'Display name', 'password')
    >>> IPerson(fresh_account)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    TypeError: ('Could not adapt', ...

    >>> person = fresh_account.createPerson(
    ...     PersonCreationRationale.OWNER_CREATED_LAUNCHPAD)
    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> person.account == fresh_account
    True
    >>> IPerson(fresh_account) == person
    True
    >>> person.preferredemail == fresh_account.preferredemail
    True
    >>> person.creation_rationale
    <DBItem PersonCreationRationale.OWNER_CREATED_LAUNCHPAD...

However, if the account has an associated person or has no preferred email
address, a new Person cannot be created.

    >>> person = fresh_account.createPerson(
    ...     PersonCreationRationale.OWNER_CREATED_LAUNCHPAD)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    AssertionError: Can't create a Person for an account which already has
    one.

    >>> print clear_account.preferredemail
    None
    >>> person = clear_account.createPerson(
    ...     PersonCreationRationale.OWNER_CREATED_LAUNCHPAD)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    AssertionError: Can't create a Person for an account which has no email.

    >>> db_policy = getUtility(IStoreSelector).pop()
