= Account =

An Account is used by someone to Authenticate with the Launchpad login
service.

>>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import (
...     IAccount, IAccountSet, AccountStatus, AccountCreationRationale)

Accounts are generally looked up by email address

>>> login('no-priv@canonical.com')
>>> account_set = getUtility(IAccountSet)
>>> account = account_set.getByEmail('no-priv@canonical.com')
>>> IAccount.providedBy(account)
True
>>> print account_set.getByEmail('invalid@whatever')
None


Only admins or the person attached to an account can see or edit
Account details. This is obviously wrong, as the account should have
access rather than the (optional) attached person. In particular,
it means Accounts without Person records cannot be managed by the
Account owner. Fixing this involves more surgery to Launchpad's
security systems.

>>> stub_account = account_set.getByEmail('stuart.bishop@canonical.com')
>>> stub_account.date_created
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
Unauthorized...
>>> del stub_account


An Account has an encrypted password and an OpenID identifier used
to generate the OpenID identity URL

>>> account.openid_identifier
u'no-priv_oid'

>>> account.password
u'K7Qmeansl6RbuPfulfcmyDQOzp70OxVh5Fcf'

Ensure the password changes are sticky, as this is a property hiding
the AccountPassword table.

>>> account.password = None
>>> account.password
>>> account.password = u'K7Qmeansl6RbuPfulfcmyDQOzp70OxVh5Fcf'
>>> account.password
u'K7Qmeansl6RbuPfulfcmyDQOzp70OxVh5Fcf'


And other account metadata

>>> account.date_created
datetime.datetime(...)
>>> print account.creation_rationale.name
OWNER_CREATED_LAUNCHPAD
>>> print account.status.name
ACTIVE

>>> account.date_status_set >= account.date_created
True
>>> print account.status_comment
None
>>> account.displayname
u'No Privileges Person'


When the status is changed, the date_status_set is updated in the
database.

>>> original_date_status_set = account.date_status_set
>>> account.status = AccountStatus.SUSPENDED
>>> from zope.security.proxy import removeSecurityProxy
>>> removeSecurityProxy(account).sync() # Shouldn't be necessary with Storm!
>>> account.date_status_set > original_date_status_set
True
>>> account.status = AccountStatus.ACTIVE


The Account's displayname is synced to the Person's displayname
if there is one. If the Person.displayname is changed, the
Account.displayname is changed too.

>>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IPersonSet
>>> personset = getUtility(IPersonSet)
>>> person = personset.getByEmail('no-priv@canonical.com')
>>> person.displayname = 'Something New'
>>> account.displayname
u'Something New'


However, the reverse is not true. If we change the Account.displayname,
the linked Person.displayname (if there is one) is not updated
immediately.  Instead, a cron job will sync this information
later. This allows displayname changes to happen even when the Person
table is unavailable.

>>> account.displayname = 'No Privileges Account'
>>> person.displayname
u'Something New'
>>> person.displayname = 'No Privileges Person'
>>> account.displayname
u'No Privileges Person'
