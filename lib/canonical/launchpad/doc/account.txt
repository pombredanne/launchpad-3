= Account and AccountSet =

An Account is used by someone to Authenticate with the Launchpad login
service.


= AccountSet =

The AccountSet object provides methods to retrieve `IAccount`s. It
implements the IAccountSet.

    >>> from zope.interface.verify import verifyObject
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces.account import (
    ...     IAccount, IAccountSet)

    >>> account_set = getUtility(IAccountSet)
    >>> verifyObject(IAccountSet, account_set)
    True


== Looking up accounts by email address ==

Accounts are generally looked up by email address.

    >>> login('no-priv@canonical.com')
    >>> account = account_set.getByEmail('no-priv@canonical.com')
    >>> IAccount.providedBy(account)
    True

    >>> print account_set.getByEmail('invalid@whatever')
    None

Only admins or the person attached to an account can see or edit Account
details. This is obviously wrong, as the account should have access
rather than the (optional) attached person. In particular, it means
Accounts without Person records cannot be managed by the Account owner.
Fixing this involves more surgery to Launchpad's security systems.

    >>> stub_account = account_set.getByEmail('stuart.bishop@canonical.com')
    >>> stub_account.date_created
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    Unauthorized...

    >>> del stub_account


== Looking up accounts by OpenID identifier ==

Each Launchpad user is assigned an permanent OpenID identity URL. The
last component of this URL is specific to the user, and can be used to
look up the user.

    >>> account = account_set.getByOpenIdIdentifier('no-priv_oid')
    >>> IAccount.providedBy(account)
    True
    >>> print account.displayname
    No Privileges Person

None is returned if the identifier is not used by any account.

    >>> print account_set.getByOpenIdIdentifier('no-such-identifier')
    None

Accounts that have not been validated are not returned either.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import (
    ...     PersonCreationRationale, IPersonSet)
    >>> personset = getUtility(IPersonSet)

    >>> person, email = personset.createPersonAndEmail(
    ...     email='whatever@example.com', name='whatever',
    ...     rationale=PersonCreationRationale.SOURCEPACKAGEIMPORT)
    >>> person.is_valid_person
    False

    >>> person.openid_identifier is not None
    True

    >>> print account_set.getByOpenIdIdentifier(person.openid_identifier)
    None


= The Account object =

The account implements the IAccount interface.

    >>> verifyObject(IAccount, account)
    True

An account has a displayname.

    >>> print account.displayname
    No Privileges Person

An account has an encrypted password.

    >>> account.password
    u'K7Qmeansl6RbuPfulfcmyDQOzp70OxVh5Fcf'

Ensure the password changes are sticky, as this is a property hiding the
AccountPassword table.

    >>> account.password = None
    >>> account.password
    >>> account.password = u'K7Qmeansl6RbuPfulfcmyDQOzp70OxVh5Fcf'
    >>> account.password
    u'K7Qmeansl6RbuPfulfcmyDQOzp70OxVh5Fcf'

And other account metadata.

    >>> account.date_created
    datetime.datetime(...)

    >>> print account.creation_rationale.name
    OWNER_CREATED_LAUNCHPAD

    >>> print account.status.name
    ACTIVE

    >>> account.date_status_set >= account.date_created
    True

    >>> print account.status_comment
    None

    >>> account.displayname
    u'No Privileges Person'

When the status is changed, the date_status_set is updated in the
database.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces.account import AccountStatus

    >>> original_date_status_set = account.date_status_set
    >>> account.status = AccountStatus.SUSPENDED

    # Shouldn't be necessary with Storm!
    >>> from zope.security.proxy import removeSecurityProxy
    >>> removeSecurityProxy(account).sync()
    >>> account.date_status_set > original_date_status_set
    True

    >>> account.status = AccountStatus.ACTIVE

The Account's displayname is synced to the Person's displayname if there
is one. If the Person.displayname is changed, the Account.displayname is
changed too.

    >>> person = personset.getByEmail('no-priv@canonical.com')
    >>> person.displayname = 'Something New'
    >>> account.displayname
    u'Something New'

However, the reverse is not true. If we change the Account.displayname,
the linked Person.displayname (if there is one) is not updated
immediately.  Instead, a cron job will sync this information later. This
allows displayname changes to happen even when the Person table is
unavailable.

    >>> account.displayname = 'No Privileges Account'
    >>> person.displayname
    u'Something New'

    >>> person.displayname = 'No Privileges Person'
    >>> account.displayname
    u'No Privileges Person'

An Account has an OpenID identifier used to generate the OpenID identity
URL.

    >>> account.openid_identifier
    u'no-priv_oid'
