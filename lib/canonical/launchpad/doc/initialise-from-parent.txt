Check the behaviour of the initialise_from_parent script. It basically
calls IDistroRelease.initialiseFromParent method with experimental extra
checks and tasks.

We need to create an initialisable DistroRelease as a child of Ubuntu
Hoary (we do it inside the ubuntutest distribution to avoid conflicts
with other tests)

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IDistributionSet
  >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests import login

  >>> login("foo.bar@canonical.com")
  >>> distribution_set = getUtility(IDistributionSet)
  >>> ubuntutest = distribution_set['ubuntutest']
  >>> ubuntu = distribution_set['ubuntu']
  >>> hoary = ubuntu['hoary']

  XXX cprov 20060529: new distrorelease should be provided by IDistribution
  This maybe affected by derivation design and is documented in bug
  #49133

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IDistroReleaseSet
  >>> distrorelease_set = getUtility(IDistroReleaseSet)
  >>> foobuntu = distrorelease_set.new(ubuntutest, 'foobuntu', 'FooBuntu',
  ...                                  'The Foobuntu', 'yeck', 'doom',
  ...                                  '888', hoary, hoary.owner)

  >>> import transaction
  >>> transaction.commit()


  >>> import subprocess
  >>> import os
  >>> import sys
  >>> from canonical.config import config


Check if it fails for an already released distrorelease:

  >>> script = os.path.join(config.root, "scripts", "ftpmaster-tools",
  ...                       "initialise-from-parent.py")
  >>> process = subprocess.Popen([sys.executable, script, "-vv",
  ...                             "breezy-autotest"],
  ...                            stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
  ...                            stderr=subprocess.PIPE,)
  >>> stdout, stderr = process.communicate()
  >>> process.returncode
  1
  >>> print stderr

Let's initialise the just created distrorelease:

  >>> process = subprocess.Popen([sys.executable, script, "-vv",
  ...                             "-d", "ubuntutest", "foobuntu"],
  ...                            stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
  ...                            stderr=subprocess.PIPE,)
  >>> stdout, stderr = process.communicate()
  >>> process.returncode
  0
  >>> print stderr
  DEBUG   Acquiring lock
  DEBUG   Initialising connection.
  DEBUG   Check empty mutable queues in parentrelease
  DEBUG   Check for no pending builds in parentrelease
  DEBUG   Copying distroarchreleases from parent and setting nominatedarchindep.
  DEBUG   initialising from parent, copying publishing records.
  DEBUG   Committing transaction.
  DEBUG   Releasing lock
  <BLANKLINE>


Checking the published sources and binaries of ubuntutest/foobuntu
against its parent, ubuntu/hoary:

  >>> hoary_pmount_pubs = hoary.getPublishedReleases('pmount')
  >>> foobuntu_pmount_pubs = foobuntu.getPublishedReleases('pmount')
  >>> len(foobuntu_pmount_pubs) == len(hoary_pmount_pubs)
  True

  >>> hoary_i386_pmount_pubs = hoary['i386'].getReleasedPackages('pmount')
  >>> foobuntu_i386_pmount_pubs = (
  ...     foobuntu['i386'].getReleasedPackages('pmount'))
  >>> len(foobuntu_i386_pmount_pubs) == len(hoary_i386_pmount_pubs)
  True

Check how the publication records behave in a just-initialise distrorelease.
First we get a binarypackagerelease published in foobuntu:

  >>> pmount_binrel = (
  ...     foobuntu['i386'].getReleasedPackages(
  ...     'pmount')[0].binarypackagerelease)
  >>> pmount_binrel.title
  u'pmount-0.1-1'

Follow BPR.build and discover it was built in the parent release:

  >>> pmount_binrel.build.id
  7
  >>> pmount_binrel.build.title
  u'i386 build of pmount 0.1-1 in ubuntu hoary RELEASE'

Now we obtain the sourcepackagerelease from the build:

  >>> pmount_srcrel = pmount_binrel.build.sourcepackagerelease
  >>> pmount_srcrel.title
  u'pmount - 0.1-1'

and check it the ISPR.getBuildByArch() would find out the same build
record for foobuntu and it's parent release (hoary):

  >>> pmount_srcrel.getBuildByArch(foobuntu['i386']).id == pmount_srcrel.getBuildByArch(hoary['i386']).id
  True

It means that queuebuilder doesn't need to create a new build record
in for pmount_0.1-1 in foobuntu.

In the other hand there is a newer source for pmount published in
hoary and consequently in foobuntu:

Note: This is a very unlikely situation, since ubuntu/hoary was marked
as RELEASED before build pmount_0.1-2 in the sampledata. So when we
try initialise a distrorelease in another distribution based on hoary,
since they have independent archives (pool), pmount_0.1-1 binary
becomes a NBS (not build from source) since the pmount_0.1-1 source
was superseded in hoary and won't be inherited by the initialised
distrorelease.

  >>> pmount_source = hoary.getSourcePackage('pmount').currentrelease
  >>> pmount_source.title
  u'pmount 0.1-2 (source) in ubuntu hoary'

  >>> pmount_source = foobuntu.getSourcePackage('pmount').currentrelease
  >>> pmount_source.title
  u'pmount 0.1-2 (source) in ubuntutest foobuntu'


Since pmount_0.1-2 source is published we can safely look up for the
respective build record:

  >>> pmount_source.sourcepackagerelease.getBuildByArch(
  ...    foobuntu['i386']) is None
  True

It's not present, Let's create it to check if getBuildByArch responds
appropriately (we won't care about the source architecturehintlist in
this test, see more details in buildd-queuebuilder)

  >>> from canonical.lp.dbschema import PackagePublishingPocket
  >>> created_build = pmount_source.sourcepackagerelease.createBuild(
  ...    foobuntu['i386'], PackagePublishingPocket.RELEASE)

  >>> retrieved_build = pmount_source.sourcepackagerelease.getBuildByArch(
  ...    foobuntu['i386'])

  >>> retrieved_build.id == created_build.id
  True

  >>> pmount_source.sourcepackagerelease.getBuildByArch(
  ...    foobuntu['hppa']) is None
  True
