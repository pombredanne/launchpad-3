Test exporting a single PO template.

Get hold of a template, and a language to export a PO file for.

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import POTemplate, LanguageSet
  >>> template = POTemplate.get(1)
  >>> language = LanguageSet()['es']

Adapt the template with to exporter.

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.components.poexport import POTemplateExporter
  >>> exporter = POTemplateExporter(template)

Then get the PO file from the exporter.

  >>> pofile = exporter.export_pofile(language)
  >>> print pofile

  "\n"
  "      <p>Thousands of sites (particularly news sites and weblogs) publish "
  "their latest headlines and/or stories in a machine-readable format so that "
  "other sites can easily link to them. This content is usually in the form of "
  "an <a href=\"http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/rss\">RSS</a> feed (which is "
  "an XML-based syndication standard).</p>\n"
  "      <p>You can read aggregated content from many sites using RSS feed "
  "readers, such as <a "
  "href=\"http://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk/\">Amphetadesk</a>.</p>\n"
  "      <p>Drupal provides the means to aggregate feeds from many sites and "
  "display these aggregated feeds to your site's visitors. To do this, enable "
  "the aggregator module in site administration and then go to the aggregator "
  "configuration page, where you can subscribe to feeds and set up other "
  "options.</p>\n"
  "      <h3>How do I find RSS feeds to aggregate?</h3>\n"
  "      <p>Many web sites (especially weblogs) display small XML icons or "
  "other obvious links on their home page. You can follow these to obtain the "
  "web address for the RSS feed. Common extensions for RSS feeds are .rss, .xml "
  "and .rdf. For example: <a href=\"http://slashdot.org/slashdot.rdf\">Slashdot "
  "RSS</a>.</p>\n"
  "      <p>If you can't find a feed for a site, or you want to find several "
  "feeds on a given topic, try an RSS syndication directory such as <a "
  "href=\"http://www.syndic8.com/\">Syndic8</a>.</p>\n"
  "      <p>To learn more about RSS, read Mark Pilgrim's <a "
  "href=\"http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2002/12/18/dive-into-xml.html\">What is "
  "RSS</a> and WebReference.com's <a "
  "href=\"http://www.webreference.com/authoring/languages/xml/rss/1/\">The "
  "Evolution of RSS</a> articles.</p>\n"
  "      <p>NOTE: Enable your site's XML syndication button by turning on the "
  "Syndicate block in block management.</p>\n"
  "      <h3>How do I add a news feed?</h3>\n"
  "      <p>To subscribe to an RSS feed on another site, use the <a href=\"% "
  "admin-news\">aggregation page</a>.</p>\n"
  "      <p>Once there, click the <a href=\"%new-feed\">new feed</a> tab. "
  "Drupal will then ask for the following:</p>\n"
  "      <ul>\n"
  "       <li><strong>Title</strong> -- The text entered here will be used in "
  "your news aggregator, within the administration configuration section, and "
  "as a title for the news feed block. As a general rule, use the web site name "
  "from which the feed originates.</li>\n"
  "       <li><strong>URL</strong> -- Here you'll enter the fully-qualified web "
  "address for the feed you wish to subscribe to.</li>\n"
  "       <li><strong>Update interval</strong> -- This is how often Drupal will "
  "scan the feed for new content. This defaults to every hour. Checking a feed "
  "more frequently that this is typically a waste of bandwidth and is "
  "considered somewhat impolite. For automatic updates to work, cron.php must "
  "be called regularly. If it is not, you'll have to manually update the feeds "
  "one at a time within the news aggregation administration page by using <a "
  "href=\"%update-items\">update items</a>.</li>\n"
  "       <li><strong>Latest items block</strong> -- The number of items "
  "selected here will determine how many of the latest items from the feed will "
  "appear in a block which may be enabled and placed in the <a "
  "href=\"%block\">blocks</a> administration page.</li>\n"
  "       <li><strong>Automatically file items</strong> -- As items are "
  "received from a feed they will be put in any categories you have selected "
  "here.</li>\n"
  "      </ul>\n"
  "      <p>Once you have submitted the new feed, check to make sure it is "
  "working properly by selecting <a href=\"%update-items\">update items</a> on "
  "the <a href=\"%admin-news\">aggregation page</a>. If you do not see any "
  "items listed for that feed, edit the feed and make sure that the URL was "
  "entered correctly.</p>\n"
  "      <h3>Adding categories</h3>\n"
  "      <p>News items can be filed into categories. To create a category, "
  "start at the <a href=\"%admin-news\">aggregation page</a>.</p>\n"
  "      <p>Once there, select <a href=\"%new-category\">new category</a> from "
  "the menu. Drupal will then ask for the following:</p>\n"
  "      <ul>\n"
  "       <li><strong>Title</strong> -- The title will be used in the <em>news "
  "by topics</em> listing in your news aggregator and for the block created for "
  "the bundle.</li>\n"
  "       <li><strong>Description</strong> -- A short description of the "
  "category to tell users more details about what news items they might find in "
  "the category.</li>\n"
  "       <li><strong>Latest items block</strong> -- The number of items "
  "selected here will determine how many of the latest items from the category "
  "will appear in a block which may be enabled and placed in the <a "
  "href=\"%block\">blocks</a> administration page.</li>\n"
  "      </ul>\n"
  "      <h3>Using the news aggregator</h3>\n"
  "      <p>The news aggregator has a number of ways that it displays your "
  "subscribed content:</p>\n"
  "      <ul>\n"
  "       <li><strong><a href=\"%news-aggregator\">News aggregator</a></strong> "
  "(latest news) -- Displays all incoming items in the order in which they were "
  "received.</li>\n"
  "       <li><strong><a href=\"%sources\">Sources</a></strong> -- Organizes "
  "incoming content by feed, displaying feed titles (each of which links to a "
  "page with the latest items from that feed) and item titles (which link to "
  "that item's actual story/article).</li>\n"
  "       <li><strong><a href=\"%categories\">Categories</a></strong> -- "
  "Organizes incoming content by category, displaying category titles (each of "
  "which links to a page with the latest items from that category) and item "
  "titles (which link to that item's actual story/article).</li>\n"
  "      </ul>\n"
  "      <p>Pages that display items (for sources, categories, etc.) display "
  "the following for each item:\n"
  "      <ul>\n"
  "       <li>The title of the item (its headline).</li>\n"
  "       <li>The categories that the item belongs to, each of which links to "
  "that particular category page as detailed above.</li>\n"
  "       <li>A description containing the first few paragraphs or a summary of "
  "the item (if available).</li>\n"
  "       <li>The name of the feed, which links to the individual feed's page, "
  "listing information about that feed and items for that feed only. This is "
  "not shown on feed pages (they would link to the page you're currently "
  "on).</li>\n"
  "      </ul>\n"
  "      <p>Additionally, users with the <em>administer news feeds "
  "permission</em> will see a link to categorize the news items. Clicking this "
  "will allow them to select which category(s) each news item is in.</p>\n"
  "      <h3>Technical details</h3>\n"
  "      <p>Drupal automatically generates an OPML feed file that is available "
  "by selecting the XML icon on the News Sources page.</p>\n"
  "      <p>When fetching feeds Drupal supports conditional GETs, this reduces "
  "the bandwidth usage for feeds that have not been updated since the last "
  "check.</p>\n"
  "      <p>If a feed is permanently moved to a new location Drupal will "
  "automatically update the feed URL to the new address.</p>"
