= Translation Export Queue =

The Translation Export Queue is the functionality that allows us to export
translation resources from the Launchpad portal.


== ExportResult ==

ExportResult class is used to control the list of exported files that succeed
and the ones that failed with the error associated.

  >>> import transaction
  >>> from zope.component import getUtility
  >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IPersonSet
  >>> from canonical.launchpad.mail.stub import test_emails
  >>> from canonical.launchpad.scripts.po_export_queue import ExportResult

  # Function to print mail content without headers.
  >>> def print_mail_body(body):
  ...     lines = body[body.index('\n\n')+2:].split('\n')
  ...     for line in lines:
  ...         print ">", line

When there is an error, the system will notify it.

To note error messages with the failure file, it should happen inside an
exception handling so we can get the exception error:

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import POTemplate
    >>> potemplate = POTemplate.get(1)
    >>> pofile = potemplate.getPOFileByLang('es')

    >>> result = ExportResult('testing export')
    >>> result.object_names.append(potemplate.displayname)
    >>> result.object_names.append(pofile.title)

Record the error.

  >>> try:
  ...     raise AssertionError, "It's just an error for testing purposes"
  ... except AssertionError:
  ...     result.addFailure()

In this case, there is an error, so there shouldn't be a URL to download
anything, if we set it, the system will fail:

  >>> result.url = 'http://someplace.com/somefile.tar.gz'

Once we are done, we should notify the user that everything failed, but
given that we set a URL, the notification will detect the programming error.
In this example, 'carlos' will be the one that did the request.

  >>> personset = getUtility(IPersonSet)
  >>> carlos = personset.getByName('carlos')
  >>> result.notify(carlos)
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
  AssertionError: We cannot have a URL for the export and a failure.

In this case, it should be None, so the notify works.

  >>> result.url = None
  >>> result.notify(carlos)

  # We need to commit the transaction to get the emails in the queue.
  >>> transaction.commit()

As usual, when there is an error, two emails should be sent:

  >>> len(test_emails) == 2
  True

  >>> while len(test_emails) > 0:
  ...     from_addrs, to_addrs, body = test_emails.pop()
  ...     if 'carlos@canonical.com' in to_addrs:
  ...         carlos_addrs = to_addrs
  ...         carlos_body = body
  ...     else:
  ...         admins_addrs = to_addrs
  ...         admins_body = body

One is for the user with the error notification.

  >>> print carlos_addrs
  ['carlos@canonical.com']
  >>> print_mail_body(carlos_body)
  > 
  > Hello Carlos Perell=C3=B3 Mar=C3=ADn,
  > 
  > Launchpad encountered problems exporting the files you requested.
  > The Launchpad Translations team has been notified of this problem.
  > Please reply to this email for further assistance.
  >

And the other to the admins.  This one lists the files that were being
exported as context to help tracking down any bugs.

  >>> print admins_addrs
  ['launchpad-error-reports@lists.canonical.com']
  >>> print_mail_body(admins_body)
  > 
  > Hello admins,
  > 
  > Launchpad encountered problems exporting translation files
  > requested by Carlos Perell=C3=B3 Mar=C3=ADn.

  > 
  > Traceback (most recent call last):

As a special case, some error messages are poisoned with non-ASCII characters
and can't be reported without triggering an error themselves.  Those are
specially handled and reported.

  >>> try:
  ...     raise AssertionError, "Really nasty \xc3 non-ASCII error!"
  ... except AssertionError:
  ...     result.addFailure()
  >>> result.notify(carlos)
  >>> transaction.commit()
  >>> len(test_emails) == 2
  True

  >>> carlos_body = None
  >>> admins_body = None
  >>> while len(test_emails) > 0:
  ...     from_addrs, to_addrs, body = test_emails.pop()
  ...     if 'carlos@canonical.com' in to_addrs:
  ...         carlos_body = body
  ...     else:
  ...         admins_body = body

The user's notification looks no different from that for an ordinary error.

  >>> print_mail_body(carlos_body)
  > 
  > Hello Carlos Perell=C3=B3 Mar=C3=ADn,
  > 
  > Launchpad encountered problems exporting the files you requested.
  > The Launchpad Translations team has been notified of this problem.
  > Please reply to this email for further assistance.

The one for the administrators, however, does not include the unprintable
exception text.

  >>> print_mail_body(admins_body)
  > 
  > Hello admins,
  > 
  > A UnicodeDecodeError occurred while trying to notify you of a
  > failure during a translation export requested by Carlos ...
  >
  > The failed request involved these objects:
  > evolution-2.2 in Evolution trunk
  > Spanish (es) translation of evolution-2.2 in Evolution trunk


Finally, there is the case when there are no errors at all. This is the usual
case.

  >>> result = ExportResult('testing export')

As noted before, result.url should be set to the URL where the user can
download the requested files. If we don't set it, the export will fail:

  >>> result.notify(carlos)
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
  AssertionError: On success, an exported URL is expected.

So let's add it:

  >>> result.url = 'http://someplace.com/somefile.tar.gz'

And notify the user.

  >>> result.notify(carlos)

  # We need to commit the transaction to get the email in the queue.
  >>> transaction.commit()

In this case, there are no errors, so we should get just a single email

  >>> len(test_emails) == 1
  True

  >>> from_addrs, to_addrs, body = test_emails.pop()

  >>> print to_addrs
  ['carlos@canonical.com']
  >>> print_mail_body(body)
  > 
  > Hello Carlos Perell=C3=B3 Mar=C3=ADn,
  > 
  > The files you requested from Launchpad are ready for
  > download from the following location:
  > 
  >     http://someplace.com/somefile.tar.gz


== process_queue() ==

This method handles entries from the queue of entries to be exported.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.scripts.po_export_queue import process_queue

First, fill the export queue with entries to be exported.

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IPOExportRequestSet
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import TranslationFileFormat
    >>> export_request_set = getUtility(IPOExportRequestSet)

The queue is empty by default.

    >>> export_request_set.entry_count
    0

Once a new entry has been added, the queue has content.

    >>> export_request_set.addRequest(
    ...     carlos, potemplates=[potemplate], format=TranslationFileFormat.PO)
    >>> export_request_set.entry_count
    1

Once the queue is processed, the queue is empty again.

    >>> import logging
    >>> process_queue(transaction, logging.getLogger())
    INFO:...Stored file at http://.../po_evolution-2.2.pot

    >>> export_request_set.entry_count
    0

And a confirmation email was sent to carlos, the importer.

    >>> len(test_emails)
    1

The confirmation email shows no errors at all.

    >>> from_addrs, to_addrs, body = test_emails.pop()
    >>> print to_addrs
    ['carlos@canonical.com']
    >>> print_mail_body(body)
    > 
    > Hello Carlos Perell=C3=B3 Mar=C3=ADn,
    > 
    > The files you requested from Launchpad are ready for
    > download from the following location:
    > 
    >     http://localhost:58000/.../po_evolution-2.2.pot

Finally, if we try to do an export with an empty queue, we don't do
anything:

    >>> process_queue(transaction, logging.getLogger())
    >>> len(test_emails)
    0
