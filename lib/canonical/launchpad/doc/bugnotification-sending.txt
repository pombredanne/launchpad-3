= Sending the Bug Notifications =

As explained in bugnotifications.txt, a change to a bug causes a bug
notification to be added. These notifications should be assembled into
an email notification, and sent to the appropriate people.

Before we start, let's ensure that there are no pending notifications to
be sent:

    >>> import pytz
    >>> from datetime import datetime, timedelta
    >>> now = datetime.now(pytz.timezone('UTC'))
    >>> ten_minutes_ago = now - timedelta(minutes=10)
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IBugNotificationSet
    >>> len(getUtility(IBugNotificationSet).getNotificationsToSend())
    0

And let's define functions to make printing out the notifications
easier.

    >>> def print_notification_headers(email_notification):
    ...     for header in ['To', 'From', 'Subject',
    ...                    'X-Launchpad-Message-Rationale']:
    ...         print "%s: %s" % (header, email_notification[header])

    >>> def print_notification(email_notification):
    ...     print_notification_headers(email_notification)
    ...     print
    ...     print email_notification.get_payload(decode=True)
    ...     print "-" * 70

You'll note that we are printing out an X-Launchpad-Message-Rationale
header. This header is a simple string that allows people to filter
bugmail according to the reason they are getting emailed. For instance,
the person may want to specially filter mail for bugs which they are
assigned to.

Anyway, let's start our demonstration by adding a comment to a bug:

    >>> login('test@canonical.com')
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IBugSet, IMessageSet
    >>> bug_one = getUtility(IBugSet).get(1)
    >>> sample_person = getUtility(ILaunchBag).user
    >>> comment = getUtility(IMessageSet).fromText(
    ...     'subject', 'a comment.', sample_person,
    ...     datecreated=ten_minutes_ago)
    >>> bug_one.addCommentNotification(comment)

    >>> notifications = getUtility(IBugNotificationSet).getNotificationsToSend()
    >>> len(notifications)
    1

If we pass these notifications to get_email_notifications, we get a
list of emails to send:

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.scripts.bugnotification import (
    ...     get_email_notifications)
    >>> email_notifications = get_email_notifications(notifications)
    >>> for bug_notifications, messages in email_notifications:
    ...     for message in messages:
    ...         print_notification(message)

    ----------------------------------------------------------------------

You can see that the message above contains the bug's initial comment's
message id as its reference, in order to make it thread properly in the
email client.

    >>> print bug_one.initial_message.rfc822msgid
    sdsdfsfd

The notification is still pending to be sent, since date_emailed is
still None:

    >>> notifications[0].date_emailed is None
    True
    >>> pending_notifications = getUtility(
    ...     IBugNotificationSet).getNotificationsToSend()
    >>> list(pending_notifications) == list(notifications)
    True

Setting date_emailed to some date causes it not to be pending anymore:

    >>> from canonical.database.sqlbase import flush_database_updates
    >>> notifications[0].date_emailed = datetime.now(pytz.timezone('UTC'))
    >>> flush_database_updates()
    >>> pending_notifications = getUtility(
    ...     IBugNotificationSet).getNotificationsToSend()
    >>> len(pending_notifications)
    0

Let's define a helper function to do that for all pending notifications:

    >>> def flush_notifications():
    ...     utc_now = datetime.now(pytz.timezone('UTC'))
    ...     pending_notifications = getUtility(
    ...         IBugNotificationSet).getNotificationsToSend()
    ...     for notification in pending_notifications:
    ...         notification.date_emailed = utc_now
    ...     flush_database_updates()


To every message that get sent out, [Bug $bugid] is prefixed to the
subject. It gets prefixed only if it's not already present in the
subject, though, which is often the case when someone replies via email.

    >>> comment = getUtility(IMessageSet).fromText(
    ...     'Re: [Bug 1] subject', 'a new comment.', sample_person,
    ...     datecreated=ten_minutes_ago)
    >>> bug_one.addCommentNotification(comment)
    >>> pending_notifications = getUtility(
    ...     IBugNotificationSet).getNotificationsToSend()
    >>> email_notifications = get_email_notifications(pending_notifications)
    >>> for bug_notifications, messages in email_notifications:
    ...     for message in messages:
    ...         print_notification(message)

Let's add a few changes and see how it looks like:

    >>> bug_one.addChangeNotification(

    ...     when=ten_minutes_ago)

    >>> pending_notifications = getUtility(

    >>> len(pending_notifications)

If we insert a comment and some more changes, they will be included in
the constructed email:

    >>> comment = getUtility(IMessageSet).fromText(
    ...     'subject', 'a new comment.', sample_person,
    ...     datecreated=ten_minutes_ago)
    >>> bug_one.addCommentNotification(comment)

    >>> bug_one.addChangeNotification(
    ...     '** Visibility changed to: Public.', sample_person,

    >>> pending_notifications = getUtility(
    ...     IBugNotificationSet).getNotificationsToSend()
    >>> len(pending_notifications)
    5

Notice how the comment is in the top of the email, and the changes are
in the order they were added:

    >>> email_notifications = get_email_notifications(pending_notifications)

    >>> flush_notifications()

We send the notification only if the user hasn't done any other changes
for the last 5 minutes:

    >>> now = datetime.now(pytz.timezone('UTC'))
    >>> for minutes_ago in reversed(range(10)):
    ...     bug_one.addChangeNotification(
    ...         '** Visibility changed to: Private.', sample_person,
    ...         when=now - timedelta(minutes=minutes_ago))
    >>> pending_notifications = getUtility(
    ...     IBugNotificationSet).getNotificationsToSend()
    >>> len(pending_notifications)
    0

    >>> flush_notifications()

A more complicated example, Sample Person does a change every minute,
but Foo Bar does a change in between:

    >>> now = datetime.now(pytz.timezone('UTC'))
    >>> for minutes_ago in reversed(range(10)):
    ...     if minutes_ago == 6:
    ...         bug_one.addChangeNotification(
    ...             '** Visibility changed to: Public.', foo_bar,
    ...             when=now - timedelta(minutes=minutes_ago))
    ...     bug_one.addChangeNotification(
    ...         '** Visibility changed to: Private.', sample_person,
    ...         when=now - timedelta(minutes=minutes_ago))
    >>> pending_notifications = getUtility(
    ...     IBugNotificationSet).getNotificationsToSend()
    >>> len(pending_notifications)
    4
    >>> for notification in pending_notifications:
    ...     print notification.id, notification.message.owner.displayname
    25 Sample Person
    26 Sample Person
    27 Sample Person
    28 Foo Bar

    >>> flush_notifications()

Let's take a more complete example, where we edit different bugs as
well:

    >>> bug_two = getUtility(IBugSet).get(2)
    >>> long_comment = getUtility(IMessageSet).fromText(
    ...     'subject',
    ...     'This is a long comment, which is longer than 72 characters.'
    ...     ' This should result in the lined being wrapped, so that it'
    ...     " won't be displayed as a single long line. Let's add another"
    ...     ' sentence just to make it longer.'
    ...     '\r\n\r\n'
    ...     "Let's add another paragraph to the comment as well, separating"
    ...     " it with dos-style line endings.",
    ...     foo_bar, datecreated=now - timedelta(minutes=6))
    >>> for minutes_ago in reversed(range(10)):
    ...     if minutes_ago == 6:
    ...         bug_one.addChangeNotification(
    ...             '** Visibility changed to: Public.', foo_bar,
    ...             when=now - timedelta(minutes=minutes_ago))
    ...         bug_one.addCommentNotification(long_comment)
    ...         bug_two.addChangeNotification(
    ...             '** Visibility changed to: Public.', foo_bar,
    ...             when=now - timedelta(minutes=minutes_ago))
    ...     bug_one.addChangeNotification(
    ...         '** Visibility changed to: Private.', sample_person,
    ...         when=now - timedelta(minutes=minutes_ago))
    ...     bug_two.addChangeNotification(
    ...         '** Visibility changed to: Private.', sample_person,
    ...         when=now - timedelta(minutes=minutes_ago))
    >>> pending_notifications = getUtility(

There's a blank line before the signature, and the signature marker has
a trailing space.

    >>> message.get_payload(decode=True).splitlines()
    ['This is a long comment, which is longer than 72 characters. This should',
     "result in the lined being wrapped, so that it won't be displayed as a",
     "single long line. Let's add another sentence just to make it longer.",
     '',
     "Let's add another paragraph to the comment as well, separating it with",
     'dos-style line endings.',
     '',
     '** Visibility changed to: Public.',
     '',
     '-- ',
     'Firefox does not support SVG',
     'http://bugs.launchpad.dev/bugs/1',
     'You received this bug notification because you are subscribed to',
     'mozilla-firefox in ubuntu.']

    >>> flush_notifications()

If a team without a contact address is subscribed to the bug, the
notification will be sent to all members individually.

    >>> shipit_admins = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('shipit-admins')
    >>> shipit_admins.preferredemail is None
    True
    >>> for member in shipit_admins.activemembers:

== Bug Filed Notification ==

Generating notifications when a new bug is filed is just a special case
of a comment notification. If we add a comment notification for the
initial message of the bug, it will result in a bug filed notification:

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import (
    ...     IDistributionSet, CreateBugParams)
    >>> ubuntu = getUtility(IDistributionSet).getByName('ubuntu')
    >>> description = getUtility(IMessageSet).fromText(
    ...     'subject', 'a description of the bug.', sample_person,
    ...     datecreated=ten_minutes_ago)
    >>> params = CreateBugParams(
    ...     msg=description, owner=sample_person, title='new bug')
    >>> new_bug = ubuntu.createBug(params)
    >>> new_bug.addCommentNotification(description)
    >>> description == new_bug.initial_message
    True

    >>> notifications = getUtility(IBugNotificationSet).getNotificationsToSend()
    >>> len(notifications)
    1

    >>> for bug_notifications, messages in get_email_notifications(notifications):
    ...     for message in messages:
    ...         print_notification_headers(message)
    ...         print
    To: support@ubuntu.com

    >>> flush_notifications()


== Duplicates ==

If the bug is a duplicate of another bug, a marker gets inserted at the
top of the email:

    >>> new_bug.duplicateof = bug_one
    >>> comment = getUtility(IMessageSet).fromText(
    ...     'subject', 'a comment.', sample_person,
    ...     datecreated=ten_minutes_ago)
    >>> new_bug.addCommentNotification(comment)
    >>> notifications = getUtility(IBugNotificationSet).getNotificationsToSend()
    >>> len(notifications)

== Security Vulnerabilities ==

When a new security related bug is filed, a small notification is
inserted at the top of the message body.

    >>> sec_vuln_description = getUtility(IMessageSet).fromText(
    ...     'Zero-day on Frobulator', 'Woah.', sample_person,
    ...     datecreated=ten_minutes_ago)
    >>> sec_vuln_bug = ubuntu.createBug(CreateBugParams(
    ...         msg=sec_vuln_description, owner=sample_person,
    ...         title='Zero-day on Frobulator',
    ...         security_related=True, private=True))
    >>> sec_vuln_bug.addCommentNotification(sec_vuln_description)

    >>> sec_vuln_bug.security_related
    True
    >>> sec_vuln_bug.private
    True

    >>> notifications = (
    ...     getUtility(IBugNotificationSet).getNotificationsToSend())
    >>> email_notifications = get_email_notifications(notifications)
    >>> for bug_notifications, messages in email_notifications:
    ...     for message in messages:
    ...         print_notification(message)

    <BLANKLINE>
    *** This bug is a security vulnerability ***
    <BLANKLINE>
    ...

    >>> flush_notifications()

The message is only inserted for new bugs, not for modified bugs:

    >>> comment = getUtility(IMessageSet).fromText(
    ...     'subject', 'a comment.', sample_person,
    ...     datecreated=ten_minutes_ago)
    >>> sec_vuln_bug.addCommentNotification(comment)

    >>> notifications = (
    ...     getUtility(IBugNotificationSet).getNotificationsToSend())
    >>> email_notifications = get_email_notifications(notifications)
    >>> for bug_notifications, messages in email_notifications:

== The cronscript ==

There's a cronsript which does the sending of the email. Let's add a
few notifications to show that it works.

    >>> comment = getUtility(IMessageSet).fromText(
    ...     'subject', 'a comment.', sample_person,
    ...     datecreated=ten_minutes_ago)
    >>> bug_one.addCommentNotification(comment)
    >>> bug_one.addChangeNotification(
    ...     '** Summary changed to: New summary.', sample_person,
    ...     when=ten_minutes_ago)
    >>> comment = getUtility(IMessageSet).fromText(
    ...     'subject', 'another comment.', sample_person,
    ...     datecreated=ten_minutes_ago)
    >>> bug_one.addCommentNotification(comment)
    >>> bug_one.addChangeNotification(
    ...     '** Summary changed to: Old summary.', sample_person,
    ...     when=ten_minutes_ago)

    >>> bug_two = getUtility(IBugSet).get(2)
    >>> comment = getUtility(IMessageSet).fromText(
    ...     'subject', 'a comment.', sample_person,
    ...     datecreated=ten_minutes_ago)
    >>> bug_two.addCommentNotification(comment)
    >>> bug_two.addChangeNotification(
    ...     '** Summary changed to: New summary.', sample_person,
    ...     when=ten_minutes_ago)

    >>> notifications = getUtility(IBugNotificationSet).getNotificationsToSend()
    >>> len(notifications)
    6

We need to commit the transaction so that the cronscript will see the
notifications.

    >>> import transaction
    >>> transaction.commit()

Now, let's run the cronscript and look at the output. Passing -v to it
makes it write out the emails it sends.

    >>> import subprocess
    >>> process = subprocess.Popen(
    ...     'cronscripts/send-bug-notifications.py -v', shell=True,
    ...     stdin=subprocess.PIPE, stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
    ...     stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
    >>> (out, err) = process.communicate()
    >>> process.returncode
    0
    >>> print err

== The X-Launchpad-Bug header ==

When a notification is sent out about a bug, the X-Launchpad-Bug header is
filled with data about that bug:

    >>> bug_three = getUtility(IBugSet).get(3)
    >>> subscription = bug_three.subscribe(sample_person, sample_person)

    >>> comment = getUtility(IMessageSet).fromText(
    ...     'subject', 'a short comment.', sample_person,
    ...     datecreated=ten_minutes_ago)
    >>> bug_three.addCommentNotification(comment)
    >>> notifications = getUtility(
    ...     IBugNotificationSet).getNotificationsToSend()
    >>> len(notifications)
    1

If we take a closer look at a notification, we can see that
X-Launchpad-Bug headers were added:

    >>> email_notifications = get_email_notifications(notifications)
    >>> for bug_notifications, messages in email_notifications:
    ...     for message in messages:
    ...         sorted(message.get_all('X-Launchpad-Bug'))
    [u'distribution=debian; distroseries=sarge;... milestone=3.1;...',
     u'distribution=debian; distroseries=woody;...',
     u'distribution=debian; sourcepackage=mozilla-firefox; component=...']

The milestone field in X-Launchpad-Bug won't be filled where no milestone is
specified:

    >>> for line in sorted(message.get_all('X-Launchpad-Bug')):
    ...     'milestone' in line
    True
    False
    False


== The X-Launchpad-Bug-Tags header ==

First, a helper function that triggers notifications by adding a
comment to a given bug, another that returns a sorted list of new
email messages, and a third that combines the first two.

    >>> def trigger_notifications(bug):
    ...     comment = getUtility(IMessageSet).fromText(
    ...         'subject', 'a short comment.', sample_person,
    ...         datecreated=ten_minutes_ago)
    ...     bug.addCommentNotification(comment)
    ...     return getUtility(
    ...         IBugNotificationSet).getNotificationsToSend()

    >>> def get_email_messages(notifications):
    ...     messages = (message
    ...         for bug_notifications, messages in
    ...             get_email_notifications(notifications)
    ...         for message in messages)
    ...     return sorted(messages, key=lambda message: message['To'])

    >>> def trigger_and_get_email_messages(bug):
    ...     flush_notifications()
    ...     notifications = trigger_notifications(bug)
    ...     return get_email_messages(notifications)

If a bug is tagged, those tags will be included in the message in the
X-Launchpad-Bug-Tags header.

    >>> bug_three.tags
    [u'layout-test']

    >>> for message in trigger_and_get_email_messages(bug_three):
    ...     message.get_all('X-Launchpad-Bug-Tags')
    [u'layout-test']
    [u'layout-test']

If we add a tag to bug three that will also be included in the header.
The tags will be space-separated to allow the list to be wrapped if it
gets over-long.

    >>> from canonical.database.sqlbase import commit
    >>> from canonical.config import config
    >>> from canonical.testing import LaunchpadZopelessLayer

    >>> commit()
    >>> LaunchpadZopelessLayer.switchDbUser('launchpad')

    >>> bug_three.unsubscribe(sample_person)
    >>> bug_three.tags = [u'layout-test', u'another-tag', u'yet-another']
    >>> commit()

    >>> LaunchpadZopelessLayer.switchDbUser(
    ...     config.malone.bugnotification_dbuser)

    >>> bug_three = getUtility(IBugSet).get(3)
    >>> for message in trigger_and_get_email_messages(bug_three):
    ...     message.get_all('X-Launchpad-Bug-Tags')
    [u'another-tag layout-test yet-another']

If we remove the tags from the bug, the X-Launchpad-Bug-Tags header
won't be included.

    >>> commit()
    >>> LaunchpadZopelessLayer.switchDbUser('launchpad')

    >>> bug_three.tags = []
    >>> commit()

    >>> LaunchpadZopelessLayer.switchDbUser(
    ...     config.malone.bugnotification_dbuser)

    >>> bug_three = getUtility(IBugSet).get(3)
    >>> for message in trigger_and_get_email_messages(bug_three):
    ...     message.get_all('X-Launchpad-Bug-Tags')


== The X-Launchpad-Bug-Private header ==

When a notification is sent out about a bug, the
X-Launchpad-Bug-Private header shows if the bug is marked as
private. It can have the value "yes" or "no".

    >>> bug_three.private
    False

    >>> for message in trigger_and_get_email_messages(bug_three):
    ...     print message['To'], message.get_all('X-Launchpad-Bug-Private')
    mark@hbd.com ['no']

Predictably, private bugs are sent with a slightly different header:

    >>> bug_three.setPrivate(True, sample_person)
    True
    >>> bug_three.private
    True

    >>> for message in trigger_and_get_email_messages(bug_three):
    ...     print message['To'], message.get_all('X-Launchpad-Bug-Private')
    mark@hbd.com ['yes']


== The X-Launchpad-Bug-Security-Vulnerability header ==

When a notification is sent out about a bug, the
X-Launchpad-Bug-Security-Vulnerability header records if the bug is a
security vulnerability. It can have the value "yes" or "no".

    >>> bug_three.security_related
    False

    >>> for message in trigger_and_get_email_messages(bug_three):
    ...     print message['To'], (
    ...         message.get_all('X-Launchpad-Bug-Security-Vulnerability'))
    mark@hbd.com ['no']

The presence of the security flag on a bug is, surprise, denoted by a
simple "yes":

    >>> bug_three.security_related = True
    >>> bug_three.security_related
    True

    >>> for message in trigger_and_get_email_messages(bug_three):
    ...     print message['To'], (
    ...         message.get_all('X-Launchpad-Bug-Security-Vulnerability'))
    mark@hbd.com ['yes']


== Verbose bug notifications ==

It is possible for users to have all the bug notifications which they
receive include the bug description and status. This helps in those
cases where the user doesn't save bug notifications, which can make
subsequent notifications seem somewhat obscure.

We'll expire all existing notifications since we're not interested in
them:

    >>> notifications = getUtility(
    ...     IBugNotificationSet).getNotificationsToSend()
    >>> len(notifications)
    1

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests import syncUpdate
    >>> for notification in notifications:
    ...     notification.date_emailed = datetime.now(pytz.timezone('UTC'))
    ...     syncUpdate(notification)


To demonstrate verbose notifications, we'll subscribe David Allouche,
who receives verbose bug notifications, to bug 15.

    >>> bug_15 = getUtility(IBugSet).get(15)
    >>> ddaa = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('ddaa')
    >>> ddaa.verbose_bugnotifications
    True

    >>> bug_15.subscribe(ddaa, sample_person)
    <...>

If we then add a comment to the bug, ddaa will receieve a notification
containing that comment.

    >>> comment = getUtility(IMessageSet).fromText(
    ...     'subject', 'a really simple comment.', sample_person,
    ...     datecreated=ten_minutes_ago)
    >>> bug_15.addCommentNotification(comment)

    >>> notifications = getUtility(
    ...     IBugNotificationSet).getNotificationsToSend()
    >>> len(notifications)
    1

If we pass this notifcation to get_email_notifications we can see that
ddaa will receieve a notification which contains the bug description and
its status in all of its targets. All other subscribers will receive
standard notifications that don't include the bug description. To help
with demonstrating this, we'll define a helper function.

    >>> def collate_messages_by_recipient(messages):
    ...     messages_by_recipient = {}
    ...     for message in messages:
    ...         recipient = message['To']
    ...         if recipient in messages_by_recipient:
    ...             messages_by_recipient[recipient].append(message)
    ...         else:
    ...             messages_by_recipient[recipient] = [message]
    ...     return messages_by_recipient

    >>> from itertools import chain
    >>> collated_messages = collate_messages_by_recipient(
    ...     chain(*(messages for bug_notifications, messages in
    ...             get_email_notifications(notifications))))

We can see that foo.bar@canonical.com doesn't receive verbose
notifications:

    >>> print_notification(collated_messages['foo.bar@canonical.com'][0])
    To: foo.bar@canonical.com
    From: Sample Person <test@canonical.com>
    Subject: [Bug 15] subject
    X-Launchpad-Message-Rationale: Subscriber
    <BLANKLINE>
    a really simple comment.

Whereas ddaa does:

    >>> print_notification(
    ...     collated_messages['david.allouche@canonical.com'][0])
    To: david.allouche@canonical.com
    From: Sample Person <test@canonical.com>
    Subject: [Bug 15] subject
