= LaunchpadView =

This is the base-class we should use for all View classes in Launchpad.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.webapp import LaunchpadView
    >>> class MyView(LaunchpadView):
    ...
    ...     def initialize(self):
    ...         print "Initalizing..."
    ...
    ...     def render(self):
    ...         return "rendered content"

    >>> context = object()
    >>> request = object()

Note that constructing a view does not initialize().

    >>> view = MyView(context, request)

Anonymous logged in, so view.user is None.

    >>> print view.user
    None

    >>> result = view()
    Initalizing...

    >>> print result
    rendered content

Now, we log in a user and see what happens to the 'user' attribute.  The
existing view should have the same user, 'None', because it was cached.

    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')
    >>> print view.user
    None

A new view should have the new user.

    >>> print MyView(context, request).user
    <...launchpad.database.person.Person instance ...>
    >>> print MyView(context, request).user.name
    name16
