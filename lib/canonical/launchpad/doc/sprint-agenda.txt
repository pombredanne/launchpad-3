Managing the Sprint Agenda
==========================

It is possible to use Blueprint to manage the agenda of a sprint or meeting.
Essentially, there is a two-stage process whereby people can nominate topics
to the sprint agenda, and then the organising committee can approve or
decline those topics.

First, lets get hold of some people, a product, a sprint and a spec.

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import ProductSet, SprintSet
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import PersonSet
    >>> upstream_firefox = ProductSet()['firefox']
    >>> canvas = upstream_firefox.getSpecification('canvas')
    >>> guacamole = SprintSet()['uds-guacamole']
    >>> danner = PersonSet().getByName('danner')
    >>> jblack = PersonSet().getByName('jblack')

Now, we should be able to see the list of sprints for the spec:

    >>> print list(canvas.sprints)
    []

And we should be able to propose the spec for the agenda:

    >>> sl = canvas.linkSprint(guacamole, jblack)
    >>> for sprint in canvas.sprints: print sprint.name
    uds-guacamole
    >>> print sl.registrant.name, sl.status.title
    jblack Proposed
    >>> print sl.decider, sl.date_decided
    None None

Now, it should be possible to accept the proposal. That should set the
status accordingly and also update the decider and the date_decided.

    >>> sl.acceptBy(danner)
    >>> print sl.status.title, sl.decider.name, sl.date_decided is not None
    Accepted danner True

It is possible to revise your choice, declining the spec. This should update
the date_decided.

    >>> transaction_timestamp = get_transaction_timestamp()

    >>> sl.date_decided = None
    >>> sl.declineBy(jblack)
    >>> print sl.status.title, sl.decider.name, sl.date_decided is not None
    Declined jblack True
    >>> print sl.date_decided == transaction_timestamp
    True
