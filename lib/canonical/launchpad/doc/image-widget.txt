= ImageChange widget =

In Launchpad we have images associated with people, products, distributions,
etc, and we want to allow people to have full control over their images. That
is, they must be able to upload a new image and delete (or keep) an existing 
one. For this we created this widget, which can be embeded into any form we 
want, which doesn't require us to add any submit buttons to indicate that the
image should be kept, deleted or changed.

The widget is composed by a RadioWidget and a FileWidget, where the radio
specifies the action that should be performed (keep the existing image, change
back to the default image or change it to an user-uploaded one) and the
FileWidget gives us the user-uploaded file, in case there is one.

Whenever you have a form in which you want to use the image widget, you have
to explicitly say whether you want to use its ADD_STYLE or EDIT_STYLE
incarnation, by passing an extra argument to the widget's constructor
(or to custom_widget(), if you're using it).

Our policy is not to ask people to upload images when creating a record, but
instead to expose this as an edit form after the object is created.

Let's use Salgado and the Launchpad Administrators team as an examples
here, since they haven't uploaded custom logos yet.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IPerson, IPersonSet
    >>> salgado = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('salgado')
    >>> salgado.logo is None
    True
    >>> admins_team = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('admins')
    >>> admins_team.logo is None
    True
    >>> admins_team.icon is None
    True

== The ADD_STYLE/EDIT_STYLE incarnations ==

The only difference between them is that the ADD_STYLE has a different
set of labels for its options and never returns our special flag to indicate
that the image should be kept, since there's nothing to be kept. For that
reason I'll only demonstrate the EDIT_STYLE here.

Since Salgado has no logo, the widget will display the default person-logo
image and the 'Keep' radio button will be selected. The
other radio button allows the user to upload a new image.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.webapp.servers import LaunchpadTestRequest
    >>> from canonical.widgets.image import ImageChangeWidget
    >>> add_style = ImageChangeWidget.ADD_STYLE
    >>> edit_style = ImageChangeWidget.EDIT_STYLE
    >>> person_logo = IPerson['logo'].bind(salgado)
    >>> widget = ImageChangeWidget(
    ...     person_logo, LaunchpadTestRequest(), edit_style)

    >>> from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup
    >>> html = widget()
    >>> print BeautifulSoup(html).find('img').get('src')
    /@@/person-logo

    >>> def print_radio_items(html):
    ...     soup = BeautifulSoup(html)
    ...     for input in soup('input', {'type': 'radio'}):
    ...         item = input.get('value')
    ...         if input.get('checked'):
    ...             item += ': SELECTED'
    ...         else:
    ...             item += ': NOT SELECTED'
    ...         print item
    >>> print_radio_items(html)
    keep: SELECTED
    change: NOT SELECTED


If we set any random file as salgado's logo, we'll see it there, as
well as an option to delete the image that was just uploaded.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import ILibraryFileAliasSet
    >>> login('guilherme.salgado@canonical.com')
    >>> logo = getUtility(ILibraryFileAliasSet)[53]
    >>> salgado.logo = logo

    # Need to create a new widget instance since we changed our context
    # manually.
    >>> widget = ImageChangeWidget(
    ...     person_logo, LaunchpadTestRequest(), edit_style)

    >>> html = widget()
    >>> logo.getURL() == BeautifulSoup(html).find('img').get('src')
    True

    >>> print_radio_items(html)
    keep: SELECTED
    delete: NOT SELECTED
    change: NOT SELECTED


Now we'll stuff values in our request to simulate a user playing with the
widget. Let's see how it reacts.

First, let's tell it to keep the existing image.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.fields import KEEP_SAME_IMAGE
    >>> form = {'field.logo.action': 'keep'}
    >>> widget = ImageChangeWidget(
    ...     person_logo, LaunchpadTestRequest(form=form), edit_style)
    >>> widget.getInputValue() == KEEP_SAME_IMAGE
    True

Then we tell it to delete the existing one.

    >>> form = {'field.logo.action': 'delete'}
    >>> widget = ImageChangeWidget(
    ...     person_logo, LaunchpadTestRequest(form=form), edit_style)
    >>> widget.getInputValue() is None
    True

And now we change it to a random image.

    >>> import canonical.launchpad
    >>> import os
    >>> from StringIO import StringIO
    >>> logo_file_name = os.path.join(
    ...     os.path.dirname(canonical.launchpad.__file__),
    ...     'images/nyet-logo.png')
    >>> logo = StringIO(open(logo_file_name, 'r').read())
    >>> logo.filename = 'logo.png'
    >>> form = {'field.logo.action': 'change',
    ...         'field.logo.image': logo}
    >>> widget = ImageChangeWidget(
    ...     person_logo, LaunchpadTestRequest(form=form), edit_style)
    >>> fileupload = widget.getInputValue()
    >>> fileupload.filename
    u'logo.png'
    >>> fileupload.content.filesize == logo.len
    True

In order for this widget to work on add forms, we need to make sure it works
when its field is bounded to an object that doesn't have the attribute that
the field represents.

    >>> personset_logo = IPerson['logo'].bind(getUtility(IPersonSet))
    >>> form = {'field.logo.action': 'keep'}
    >>> widget = ImageChangeWidget(
    ...     personset_logo, LaunchpadTestRequest(form=form), add_style)

Note that in this case the KEEP_SAME_IMAGE flag doesn't make sense, so we
return None, which is a sensible value that can be fed to a method which
creates a new database object for us.

    >>> widget.getInputValue() == None
    True
    >>> print_radio_items(widget())
    keep: SELECTED
    change: NOT SELECTED

    >>> form = {'field.logo.action': 'change',
    ...         'field.logo.image': logo}
    >>> widget = ImageChangeWidget(
    ...     personset_logo, LaunchpadTestRequest(form=form), add_style)
    >>> print_radio_items(widget())
    keep: NOT SELECTED
    change: SELECTED
    >>> widget.getInputValue().content.filesize == logo.len
    True

#    >>> scale == orig_scale
#    True
#
#When we want to delete the image, it'll return a two-tuple of None, so that

#
#    >>> form = {'field.gotchi.action': 'delete'}
#    >>> widget = GotchiTiedWithHeadingWidget(
#    ...     person_gotchi, LaunchpadTestRequest(form=form), edit_style)
#    >>> widget.getInputValue()
#    (None, None)
#
#The same holds for when we want to keep an image.

#    True


== The IconImageUpload, LogoImageUpload and MugshotImageUpload fields ==

There are three fields which are used for image uploads. They are all
subsclasses of the same BaseImageUpload class, and the only thing they
change in each case is the max_size exact dimensions. We will only test the
IconImageUpload and MugshotImageUpload widgets below.

Since this is a special widget which returns a special object
(KEEP_SAME_IMAGE) to indicate that the image should be kept, we need to use
a custom field (IconImageUpload) together with it. That field should not be
used directly, since it specifies some constraints and defaults that are
specific to each image, so you must subclass it before using.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.fields import (BaseImageUpload,
    ... IconImageUpload)

Note: the .bind method here is fetching the field from the IPerson schema
(which should be an IconImageUpload, a subclass of BaseImageUpload) and
binding it to Launchpad Administrators.

    >>> person_icon = IPerson['icon'].bind(admins_team)
    >>> isinstance(person_icon, BaseImageUpload)
    True
    >>> isinstance(person_icon, IconImageUpload)
    True
    >>> person_icon.max_size
    5120
    >>> person_icon.dimensions
    (14, 14)

If we pass that special object (KEEP_SAME_IMAGE) to IconImageUpload's set()
method, the current image will be kept.

    >>> admins_team.icon = getUtility(ILibraryFileAliasSet)[53]
    >>> existing_img = admins_team.icon
    >>> existing_img is None
    False

    >>> person_icon.set(admins_team, KEEP_SAME_IMAGE)
    >>> admins_team.icon == existing_img
    True

On the other hand, if we pass None, the current image will be removed.

    >>> person_icon.set(admins_team, None)
    >>> admins_team.icon is None
    True

Similarly, passing any file of the type expected (FileUpload) will
change the current image to the given file.

    >>> person_icon.set(admins_team, fileupload)
    >>> admins_team.icon is None
    False
    >>> admins_team.icon == existing_img
    False


# This section is disabled until we have implemented a similar but imrpved
# Wdiget, that lets you OPTIONALLY resize from the mugshot, OR upload a
# custom Logo

#=== The LargeImageUpload field ===
#
#This is a special version of the BaseImageUpload one which knows how to handle
#the two images returned by GotchiTiedWithHeadingWidget. The first image is
#stored in the attribute the field represents and the other one is stored on
#an attribute called gotchi_heading of the same object. Any class in which this
#field is used must provide a gotchi_heading attribute.
#
#    >>> from canonical.launchpad.fields import LargeImageUpload
#    >>> person_gotchi.__class__ == LargeImageUpload
#    True
#
#    >>> existing_img = salgado.gotchi
#    >>> existing_img is None
#    False
#
#    >>> person_gotchi.set(salgado, (KEEP_SAME_IMAGE, KEEP_SAME_IMAGE))
#    >>> salgado.gotchi == existing_img
#    True
#
#    >>> person_gotchi.set(salgado, (None, None))
#    >>> salgado.gotchi is None
#
#True
#
#Unlike the normal BaseImageUpload implementation, this one doesn't handle a
#single LibraryFileAlias --it only handles tuples of them.
#
#    >>> person_gotchi.set(salgado, fileupload)
#    Traceback (most recent call last):
#    ...
#    AssertionError
#
#    >>> person_gotchi.set(
#    ...     salgado, (fileupload, getUtility(ILibraryFileAliasSet)[53]))
#    >>> salgado.gotchi is None
#    False
#    >>> salgado.gotchi == existing_img
#    False
#
#    >>> salgado.gotchi_heading is None
#    False
#    >>> salgado.gotchi_heading == salgado.gotchi
#    False


== Input validation ==

The BaseImageUpload field expects an image with the exact dimensions and
within the stated constraints, so it won't accept anything else.

We will try submit a logo to the mugshot image upload widget. Since we have
an image with a byte size smaller than person_mugshot.max_size BUT dimensions
smaller than person_mugshot.dimensions, it must be rejected.

    >>> import PIL.Image
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.fields import MugshotImageUpload
    >>> person_mugshot = IPerson['mugshot'].bind(salgado)
    >>> logo_file_name = os.path.join(
    ...     os.path.dirname(canonical.launchpad.__file__),
    ...     'images/nyet-logo.png')
    >>> logo = StringIO(open(logo_file_name, 'r').read())
    >>> logo.filename = 'logo.png'
    >>> logo.len <= person_mugshot.max_size
    True
    >>> image = PIL.Image.open(logo)
    >>> image.size <= person_mugshot.dimensions
    True

    >>> form = {'field.mugshot.action': 'change', 'field.mugshot.image': logo}
    >>> widget = ImageChangeWidget(
    ...     person_mugshot, LaunchpadTestRequest(form=form), edit_style)
    >>> widget.getInputValue()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    WidgetInputError: ('field.mugshot', u'Mugshot',
                       This image is not exactly 192x192 pixels in size.)


This is what we see when the image is the correct dimensions, and within the
max_size:

    >>> mugshot_file_name = os.path.join(
    ...     os.path.dirname(canonical.launchpad.__file__),
    ...     'images/nyet-mugshot.png')
    >>> mugshot = StringIO(open(mugshot_file_name, 'r').read())
    >>> mugshot.filename = 'mugshot.png'

Image is a small enough file:

    >>> mugshot.len <= person_mugshot.max_size
    True

Image is the correct dimensions:

    >>> image = PIL.Image.open(mugshot)
    >>> image.size == person_mugshot.dimensions
    True

    >>> form = {'field.mugshot.action': 'change',
    ...         'field.mugshot.image': mugshot}
    >>> widget = ImageChangeWidget(
    ...     person_mugshot, LaunchpadTestRequest(form=form), edit_style)
    >>> fileupload = widget.getInputValue()
    >>> fileupload.filename
    u'mugshot.png'
    >>> fileupload.content.filesize == mugshot.len
    True

If we change person_mugshot's max_size to be smaller than our test image, we'll
get a validation error.

    >>> person_mugshot.max_size = mugshot.len - 1
    >>> mugshot.seek(0)
    >>> widget = ImageChangeWidget(
    ...     person_mugshot, LaunchpadTestRequest(form=form), edit_style)
    >>> widget.getInputValue()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    WidgetInputError: ('field.mugshot', u'Mugshot',
                       This image exceeds the maximum allowed size in bytes.)

A similar error will be raised if the image's dimensions are bigger than the
maximum we allow.

    >>> person_mugshot.max_size = mugshot.len
    >>> person_mugshot.dimensions = (image.size[0] - 1, image.size[1] + 1)
    >>> mugshot.seek(0)
    >>> widget = ImageChangeWidget(
    ...     person_mugshot, LaunchpadTestRequest(form=form), edit_style)
    >>> widget.getInputValue()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    WidgetInputError: ('field.mugshot', u'Mugshot',
                       This image is not exactly 191x193 pixels in size.)

    >>> person_mugshot.dimensions = (image.size[0] + 1, image.size[1] - 1)
    >>> mugshot.seek(0)
    >>> widget = ImageChangeWidget(
    ...     person_mugshot, LaunchpadTestRequest(form=form), edit_style)
    >>> widget.getInputValue()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    WidgetInputError: ('field.mugshot', u'Mugshot',
                       This image is not exactly 193x191 pixels in size.)

We also won't accept anything that is not an image; that is, we only accept
what can be parsed by the Python Imaging Library module.

    >>> mugshot = StringIO('foo bar bz')
    >>> mugshot.filename = 'foo.jpg'
    >>> form = {'field.mugshot.action': 'change',
    ...         'field.mugshot.image': mugshot}
    >>> widget = ImageChangeWidget(
    ...     person_mugshot, LaunchpadTestRequest(form=form), edit_style)
    >>> widget.getInputValue()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    WidgetInputError: ('field.mugshot', u'Mugshot',
                       The file uploaded was not recognized as an image;
                       please check it and retry.)

Finally, if the user specifies the 'change' action he must also provide a file
to be uploaded.

    >>> form = {'field.mugshot.action': 'change', 'field.mugshot.image': ''}
    >>> widget = ImageChangeWidget(
    ...     person_mugshot, LaunchpadTestRequest(form=form), edit_style)
    >>> widget.getInputValue()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    WidgetInputError: ('field.mugshot', u'Mugshot',
                       Please specify the image you want to use.)


== Non-exact Image Dimensions ==

For some input fields, we don't require a particular size for an
image, but want to enforce a maximum size on the image.  This can be
achieved by setting the exact_dimensions attribute of the field to
False:

    >>> person_mugshot.exact_dimensions = False
    >>> person_mugshot.dimensions = (64, 64)
    >>> mugshot = StringIO(open(mugshot_file_name, 'r').read())
    >>> mugshot.filename = 'mugshot.png'
    >>> form = {'field.mugshot.action': 'change',
    ...         'field.mugshot.image': mugshot}
    >>> widget = ImageChangeWidget(
    ...     person_mugshot, LaunchpadTestRequest(form=form), edit_style)
    >>> widget.getInputValue()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    WidgetInputError: ('field.mugshot', u'Mugshot',
                       This image is larger than 64x64 pixels in size.)

If the image is smaller than the dimensions, the input validates:

    >>> person_mugshot.dimensions = (256, 256)
    >>> mugshot.seek(0)
    >>> widget = ImageChangeWidget(
    ...     person_mugshot, LaunchpadTestRequest(form=form), edit_style)
    >>> fileupload = widget.getInputValue()
    >>> fileupload.filename
    u'mugshot.png'

The same occurs if the image matches the specified dimensions:

    >>> person_mugshot.dimensions = (192, 192)
    >>> mugshot.seek(0)
    >>> widget = ImageChangeWidget(
    ...     person_mugshot, LaunchpadTestRequest(form=form), edit_style)
    >>> fileupload = widget.getInputValue()
    >>> fileupload.filename
    u'mugshot.png'
