Specifications
==============

A feature specification is a document that describes an idea for an
enhancement to a product. Launchpad allows you to register your
specification and then walk it through the approval process. You can have
specifications for products, and also for distributions.

All Milestone creation and retrieval is done through IMilestoneSet.
IMilestoneSet can be accessed as a utility.

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import ISpecificationSet
    >>> specset = getUtility(ISpecificationSet)

To create a new Specification, use ISpecificationSet.new:

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IProductSet
    >>> productset = getUtility(IProductSet)
    >>> upstream_firefox = productset.get(4)
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import Person
    >>> from canonical.lp.dbschema import SpecificationPriority
    >>> from canonical.lp.dbschema import SpecificationStatus
    >>> sabdfl = Person.byName('sabdfl')
    >>> newspec = specset.new('mng', 'Support MNG Format', 'http://www.silly.me/SpecName', 'we really need this', SpecificationStatus.APPROVED, sabdfl, product=upstream_firefox)
    >>> print newspec.name
    mng

A specification could be attached to a distribution, or a product. We call
this the specification target.

    >>> print newspec.target.name
    firefox

We attach now a spec to a distribution.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import ILaunchpadCelebrities
    >>> ubuntu = getUtility(ILaunchpadCelebrities).ubuntu
    >>> sabdfl = Person.byName('sabdfl')
    >>> ubuspec = specset.new('fix-spec-permissions',
    ...                       'Fix Specification Permissions',
    ...                       'http://www.ubuntu.com/FixBrokenSpecPerms',
    ...                       'we really need this',
    ...                       SpecificationStatus.APPROVED,
    ...                       sabdfl,
    ...                       distribution=ubuntu)
    >>> print ubuspec.name
    fix-spec-permissions

The Ubuntu distro is owned by the Ubuntu team, ubuntu-team. jdub is a member,
and therefore should be able to edit any spec attached to it (but not
specs attached to mozilla-firefox).

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.helpers import check_permission
    >>> print ubuntu.owner.name
    ubuntu-team
    >>> jdub = Person.byName('jdub')
    >>> jdub.inTeam(ubuntu.owner)
    True
    >>> login(jdub.preferredemail.email)
    >>> check_permission('launchpad.Edit', ubuspec)
    True
    >>> check_permission('launchpad.Edit', newspec)
    False
