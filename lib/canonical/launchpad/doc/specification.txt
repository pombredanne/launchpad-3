Specifications
==============

A feature specification is a document that describes an idea for an
enhancement to a product. Launchpad allows you to register your
specification and then walk it through the approval process. You can have
specifications for products, and also for distributions.

All Milestone creation and retrieval is done through IMilestoneSet.
IMilestoneSet can be accessed as a utility.

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import ISpecificationSet
    >>> specset = getUtility(ISpecificationSet)

To create a new Specification, use ISpecificationSet.new:

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import (
    ...     IProductSet, SpecificationDefinitionStatus, 
    ...     SpecificationImplementationStatus, SpecificationPriority)
    >>> productset = getUtility(IProductSet)
    >>> upstream_firefox = productset.get(4)
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import Person
    >>> sabdfl = Person.byName('sabdfl')
    >>> newspec = specset.new('mng', 'Support MNG Format',
    ...     'http://www.silly.me/SpecName', 'we really need this',
    ...     SpecificationDefinitionStatus.APPROVED, sabdfl,
    ...     product=upstream_firefox)
    >>> print newspec.name
    mng

It should be possible to retrieve a specification by its name
    >>> upstream_firefox.getSpecification('mng').name
    u'mng'

And if we try to retrieve a non-existent specification we should get None
    >>> print upstream_firefox.getSpecification('nonexistentspec')
    None

It's also possible to retrieve a specification by its URL
    >>> specset.getByURL('http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/SVG').specurl
    u'http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/SVG'

And if there's no specification with the given URL we should get None
    >>> print specset.getByURL('http://no-url.com')
    None

A specification could be attached to a distribution, or a product. We call
this the specification target.

    >>> print newspec.target.name
    firefox

We attach now a spec to a distribution.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import ILaunchpadCelebrities
    >>> ubuntu = getUtility(ILaunchpadCelebrities).ubuntu
    >>> sabdfl = Person.byName('sabdfl')
    >>> ubuspec = specset.new('fix-spec-permissions',
    ...                       'Fix Specification Permissions',
    ...                       'http://www.ubuntu.com/FixBrokenSpecPerms',
    ...                       'we really need this',
    ...                       SpecificationDefinitionStatus.APPROVED,
    ...                       sabdfl,
    ...                       distribution=ubuntu)
    >>> print ubuspec.name
    fix-spec-permissions

The Ubuntu distro is owned by the Ubuntu team, ubuntu-team. jdub is a member,
and therefore should be able to edit any spec attached to it (but not
specs attached to mozilla-firefox).

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.webapp.authorization import check_permission
    >>> print ubuntu.owner.name
    ubuntu-team
    >>> jdub = Person.byName('jdub')
    >>> jdub.inTeam(ubuntu.owner)
    True
    >>> login(jdub.preferredemail.email)
    >>> check_permission('launchpad.Edit', ubuspec)
    True
    >>> check_permission('launchpad.Edit', newspec)
    False


SpecificationDelta
------------------

When we modify a specification, we can get a delta of the changes using
ISpecification.getDelta(). If there are no changes, None will be
returned:

    >>> from canonical.database.constants import UTC_NOW
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IBugSet
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.webapp.snapshot import Snapshot
    >>> from zope.interface import providedBy
    >>> unmodified_spec = Snapshot(ubuspec, providing=providedBy(ubuspec))
    >>> ubuspec.getDelta(unmodified_spec, jdub) is None
    True

Now, let's do a bunch of changes, and see what the result looks like:

    >>> ubuspec.title = 'New Title'
    >>> ubuspec.summary = 'New summary.'
    >>> ubuspec.specurl = 'http://www.ubuntu.com/NewSpec'
    >>> ubuspec.proposeGoal(ubuntu.getSeries('hoary'), jdub)
    >>> ubuspec.name = 'new-spec'
    >>> ubuspec.priority = SpecificationPriority.LOW
    >>> ubuspec.definition_status = SpecificationDefinitionStatus.DRAFT
    >>> ubuspec.whiteboard = 'New whiteboard comments.'
    >>> ubuspec.approver = sabdfl
    >>> ubuspec.assignee = jdub
    >>> ubuspec.drafter = jdub
    >>> ubuspec.linkBug(getUtility(IBugSet).get(2))
    <...>

    >>> delta = ubuspec.getDelta(unmodified_spec, jdub)
    >>> delta.specification == ubuspec
    True
    >>> delta.user == jdub
    True

    >>> print delta.title
    New Title
    >>> print delta.summary
    New summary.
    >>> print delta.whiteboard
    New whiteboard comments.
    >>> print delta.specurl
    http://www.ubuntu.com/NewSpec
    >>> print delta.distroseries.name
    hoary

    >>> print delta.name['old']
    fix-spec-permissions
    >>> print delta.name['new']
    new-spec

    >>> print delta.priority['old'].title
    Undefined
    >>> print delta.priority['new'].title
    Low

    >>> print delta.definition_status['old'].title
    Approved
    >>> print delta.definition_status['new'].title
    Drafting

    >>> print delta.approver['old'] is None
    True
    >>> print delta.approver['new'] == sabdfl
    True

    >>> print delta.assignee['old'] is None
    True
    >>> print delta.assignee['new'] == jdub
    True

    >>> print delta.drafter['old'] is None
    True
    >>> print delta.drafter['new'] == jdub
    True

    >>> [linked_bug.id for linked_bug in delta.bugs_linked]
    [2]

    >>> delta.bugs_unlinked is None
    True
    >>> delta.milestone is None
    True
    >>> delta.productseries is None
    True
    >>> delta.target is None
    True


Specification Searching
=======================

The "SpecificationSet" can be used to search across all specifications.

We can filter for specifications that contain specific text, across all
specifications:

 >>> for spec in specset.specifications(filter=['install']):
 ...     print spec.name, spec.target.name
 cluster-installation kubuntu
 extension-manager-upgrades firefox
 media-integrity-check ubuntu

Specs from inactive products are filtered out.

 >>> from canonical.database.sqlbase import flush_database_updates
 >>> login('mark@hbd.com')
 >>> upstream_firefox.active = False
 >>> flush_database_updates()
 >>> for spec in specset.specifications(filter=['install']):
 ...     print spec.name, spec.target.name
 cluster-installation kubuntu
 media-integrity-check ubuntu


Reset firefox so we don't mess up later tests.

 >>> upstream_firefox.active = True
 >>> flush_database_updates()


Specification Blockers and Dependencies
=======================================

We keep track of specification blocking and dependencies. For each spec, you
can ask for its dependencies, or the specs which it blocks. And you can ask
for the full set of dependencies-and-their-dependencies, as well as the full
set of specs-which-block-this-one-and-all-the-specs-that-block-them-too.

 >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IProductSet
 >>> efourx = getUtility(IProductSet).getByName('firefox').getSpecification('e4x')
 >>> for spec in efourx.dependencies: print spec.name
 svg-support
 >>> for spec in efourx.all_deps: print spec.name
 svg-support
 >>> for spec in efourx.blocked_specs: print spec.name
 canvas
 >>> for spec in efourx.all_blocked: print spec.name
 canvas
 >>> canvas = efourx.blocked_specs[0]
 >>> svg = efourx.dependencies[0]
 >>> for spec in svg.all_blocked: print spec.name
 e4x
 canvas
 >>> for spec in canvas.all_deps: print spec.name
 svg-support
 e4x


Specification Subscriptions
===========================

You can subscribe to a specification, which means that you will be notified
of changes to that spec (and changes to the wiki page for that spec will be
passed on to you too!).

It is possible to indicate that some subscribers are essential to the
discussion of the spec.

 >>> for subscriber in canvas.subscribers: print subscriber.name

 >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IPersonSet
 >>> jdub = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('jdub')
 >>> sub = canvas.subscribe(jdub, jdub, False)
 >>> print sub.essential
 False

 >>> samesub = canvas.getSubscriptionByName('jdub')
 >>> print samesub.essential
 False



Specification Goals
===================

We can propose a specification as a feature goal for a particular series
or distroseries. That spec can then be approved or declined by the series
drivers.

First, we will show how to propose a goal, and what metadata is recorded
when we do.

 >>> e4x = upstream_firefox.getSpecification('e4x')
 >>> onezero = upstream_firefox.getSeries('1.0')
 >>> e4x.goal is not None
 False
 >>> e4x.goal_proposer is not None
 False
 >>> e4x.date_goal_proposed is not None
 False
 >>> e4x.proposeGoal(onezero, jdub)
 >>> e4x.goal is not None
 True
 >>> e4x.goal_proposer.name
 u'jdub'
 >>> e4x.date_goal_proposed is not None
 True
 >>> e4x.goalstatus.title
 'Proposed'

At this stage, the feature goal is not approved.

 >>> e4x.goal_decider is not None
 False
 >>> e4x.date_goal_decided is not None
 False

We can then accept the goal.

 >>> e4x.acceptBy(sabdfl)
 >>> e4x.goalstatus.title
 'Accepted'
 >>> e4x.goal_decider.name
 u'sabdfl'
 >>> e4x.date_goal_decided is not None
 True

We can change our mind, and decline the goal now.

 >>> e4x.declineBy(sabdfl)
 >>> e4x.goalstatus.title
 'Declined'

And finally, if we propose a new goal, then the decision status is
invalidated.

 >>> trunk = upstream_firefox.getSeries('trunk')
 >>> e4x.proposeGoal(trunk, sabdfl)
 >>> e4x.goalstatus.title
 'Proposed'
 >>> e4x.goal_decider is not None
 False
 >>> e4x.date_goal_decided is not None
 False


Specification Lifecycle
=======================

We keep track of the progress of the specification, from being "not
started", to "started", to "complete", and we track who started it and who
finished it, and when they updated the relevant status bits. Currently this
is done by setting the statuses, then calling a method which examines the
state of the spec and updates any lifecycle metadata that needs updating.

We will use the "canvas" spec to show of this lifecycle tracking.

First, lets show that canvas has not really progressed very far.

 >>> canvas.definition_status.title
 'New'
 >>> canvas.implementation_status.title
 'Unknown'
 >>> print canvas.starter
 None
 >>> canvas.informational
 False

Now, we want to show that setting the states can update the relevant
metadata. First we will make the spec "started".

 >>> canvas.implementation_status = SpecificationImplementationStatus.STARTED
 >>> newstate = canvas.updateLifecycleStatus(jdub)
 >>> newstate is None
 False
 >>> print newstate.title
 Started
 >>> canvas.starter is not None # update should have set starter
 True
 >>> canvas.date_started is not None # and date started
 True
 >>> canvas.completer is not None # but this is still incomplete
 False
 >>> canvas.date_completed is not None
 False

Now we are making slow progress. We want to show that, from a lifecycle
point of view, nothing has changed, so we expect the lifecycle update to
return None.

 >>> canvas.implementation_status = SpecificationImplementationStatus.SLOW
 >>> newstate = canvas.updateLifecycleStatus(jdub)
 >>> newstate is None
 True

Oops! Let's say that was a mistake, we instead want to DEFER the start
of this work.

 >>> canvas.implementation_status = SpecificationImplementationStatus.DEFERRED
 >>> newstate = canvas.updateLifecycleStatus(jdub)
 >>> newstate is None
 False
 >>> print newstate.title
 Not started
 >>> canvas.starter is not None # update should have reset starter
 False
 >>> canvas.date_started is not None # and date started
 False
 >>> canvas.completer is not None # but this is still incomplete
 False
 >>> canvas.date_completed is not None
 False

Now, let's say that we have actually completed this spec.

 >>> canvas.implementation_status = SpecificationImplementationStatus.IMPLEMENTED
 >>> canvas.definition_status = SpecificationDefinitionStatus.APPROVED
 >>> newstate = canvas.updateLifecycleStatus(jdub)
 >>> newstate is None
 False
 >>> print newstate.title
 Complete
 >>> canvas.starter is not None # update should have set starter
 True
 >>> canvas.date_started is not None # and date started
 True
 >>> canvas.completer is not None # but this is still incomplete
 True
 >>> canvas.date_completed is not None
 True

Hmm... now we want to roll back. We can roll back either to "started" or
all the way to "not started".

 >>> canvas.implementation_status = SpecificationImplementationStatus.NOTSTARTED
 >>> canvas.definition_status = SpecificationDefinitionStatus.APPROVED
 >>> newstate = canvas.updateLifecycleStatus(jdub)
 >>> newstate is None
 False
 >>> print newstate.title
 Not started
 >>> canvas.starter is not None # update should have reset starter
 False
 >>> canvas.date_started is not None # and date started
 False
 >>> canvas.completer is not None # but this is still incomplete
 False
 >>> canvas.date_completed is not None
 False

OK. Let's make it complete again.

 >>> canvas.implementation_status = SpecificationImplementationStatus.IMPLEMENTED
 >>> canvas.definition_status = SpecificationDefinitionStatus.APPROVED
 >>> newstate = canvas.updateLifecycleStatus(jdub)
 >>> newstate is None
 False
 >>> print newstate.title
 Complete
 >>> canvas.starter is not None # update should have set starter
 True
 >>> canvas.date_started is not None # and date started
 True
 >>> canvas.completer is not None # this is complete
 True
 >>> canvas.date_completed is not None
 True

And finally show the rollback to "started".

 >>> canvas.implementation_status = SpecificationImplementationStatus.STARTED
 >>> canvas.definition_status = SpecificationDefinitionStatus.APPROVED
 >>> newstate = canvas.updateLifecycleStatus(jdub)
 >>> newstate is None
 False
 >>> print newstate.title
 Started
 >>> canvas.starter is not None # update should have set starter
 True
 >>> canvas.date_started is not None # and date started
 True
 >>> canvas.completer is not None # but this is still incomplete
 False
 >>> canvas.date_completed is not None
 False
