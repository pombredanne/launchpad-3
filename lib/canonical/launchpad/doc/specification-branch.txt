= Specification Branch Links =

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.webapp.testing import verifyObject
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import ISpecificationBranch
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import SpecificationBranch
    >>> verifyObject(ISpecificationBranch, SpecificationBranch.get(1))
    True

A specification can be linked to a number of branches.  For example,
the Ubuntu media-integrity-check specifcation has a branch link:

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import (
    ...     IBranchSet, ILaunchpadCelebrities, IPersonSet)
    >>> ubuntu = getUtility(ILaunchpadCelebrities).ubuntu
    >>> spec = ubuntu.getSpecification('media-integrity-check')

    >>> for branchlink in spec.branch_links:
    ...     print branchlink.branch.unique_name
    ~name12/+junk/junk.dev

A spec link has a summary attached to it:

    >>> branchlink = spec.branch_links[0]
    >>> branchlink.summary
    u'This branch should fix the issue'

The summary can only be changed by non-anonymous users:

    >>> branchlink.summary = 'New summary'
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    Unauthorized: (... 'launchpad.AnyPerson')
    >>> login('test@canonical.com')
    >>> branchlink.summary = 'New summary'

We can create a new branch link with the linkBranch() method:

    >>> branch = getUtility(IBranchSet).getByUniqueName(
    ...     '~name12/+junk/junk.contrib')
    >>> user = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByEmail('test@canonical.com')
    >>> branchlink = spec.linkBranch(branch, user, 'A summary')

The branch link records the person who created the link as the registrant.

    >>> print branchlink.registrant.displayname
    Sample Person

Now the branch has two branch links:

    >>> for branchlink in spec.branch_links:
    ...     print branchlink.branch.unique_name
    ~name12/+junk/junk.dev
    ~name12/+junk/junk.contrib

Similarly, the branch has a list of attached specifications:

    >>> for speclink in branch.spec_links:
    ...     print speclink.specification.name
    media-integrity-check

We can also look up a branch link with the getBranchLink() method:

    >>> branchlink = spec.getBranchLink(branch)
    >>> branchlink.specification == spec
    True
    >>> branchlink.branch == branch
    True
    >>> branchlink.summary
    u'A summary'

Finally, the branch link can be removed using its destroySelf()
method:

    >>> branchlink.destroySelf()
    >>> for branchlink in spec.branch_links:
    ...     print branchlink.branch.unique_name
    ~name12/+junk/junk.dev
