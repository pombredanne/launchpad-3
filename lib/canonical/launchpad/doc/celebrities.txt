There are a number of special objects, some of which exist in the database,
which we want to give easy access to in the code.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IPersonSet
    >>> celebs = getUtility(ILaunchpadCelebrities)

The admins team will be renamed to the 'super' team in due course.  Meanwhile,
we need to have the admins team in ILaunchpadCelebrities.

    >>> celebs.admin == admins
    True

operations.
