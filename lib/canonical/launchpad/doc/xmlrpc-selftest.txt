= XMLRPC self-test API =

The Launchpad root object has a simple XMLRPC API to show that XMLRPC works.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.xmlrpc.application import SelfTest, ISelfTest
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.webapp.testing import verifyObject
    >>> selftestview = SelfTest('somecontext', 'somerequest')
    >>> verifyObject(ISelfTest, selftestview)
    True
    >>> selftestview.concatenate('foo', 'bar')
    u'foo bar'
    >>> selftestview.make_fault()
    <Fault 666: 'Yoghurt and spanners.'>

We can test our XMLRPC APIs using xmlrpclib, using a custom Transport
which talks with the publisher directly.

    >>> import xmlrpclib
    >>> from lp.testing.xmlrpc import XMLRPCTestTransport
    >>> selftest = xmlrpclib.ServerProxy(
    ...     'http://xmlrpc.launchpad.dev/', transport=XMLRPCTestTransport())
    >>> selftest.concatenate('foo', 'bar')
    'foo bar'
    >>> selftest.make_fault()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    Fault: <Fault 666: 'Yoghurt and spanners.'>


== Unexpected Exceptions ==

Sometimes an XML-RPC method will be buggy, and raise an exception
other than xmlrpclib.Fault.  We have such a method on the self test
view:

    >>> selftestview.raise_exception()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    RuntimeError: selftest exception


As with normal browser requests, we don't want to expose these error
messages to the user since they could contain confidential
information.  Such exceptions get converted to a fault listing the
OOPS ID (assuming one was generated):

    >>> selftest.raise_exception()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    Fault: <Fault -1: 'OOPS-...'>


== Authentication ==

    >>> selftest.hello()
    'Hello Anonymous.'

The last call returned 'Anonymous', since we didn't provided a username
and a password. If we do that, hello() will print the name of the
logged in user:

    >>> selftest = xmlrpclib.ServerProxy(
    ...     'http://test@canonical.com:test@xmlrpc.launchpad.dev/',
    ...     transport=XMLRPCTestTransport())
    >>> selftest.hello()
    'Hello Sample Person.'

The interactions in this test, and the interaction in the XMLRPC
methods are different, so we still have an anonymous interaction in
this test.

    >>> getUtility(ILaunchBag).user is None
    True

Even if we log in as Foo Bar here, the XMLRPC method will see Sample
Person as the logged in user.

    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')
    >>> selftest.hello()
    'Hello Sample Person.'

    >>> print getUtility(ILaunchBag).user.displayname
    Foo Bar
