= Script Monitoring =

To help monitor the health of the various cron jobs that keep
Launchpad running, we record the status of successful script runs in
the database.  This data can then be used for the following:

 * Check that the script is running as often as it should.
 * Check that the script has run recently.
 * Check that the script's average runtime is sensible.


== Recording Successful Runs ==

When a script completes successfully, it should record the fact in the
database.  This is performed with a call to
IScriptActivitySet.recordSuccess():

  >>> import datetime
  >>> import os
  >>> import socket
  >>> import subprocess
  >>> import sys
  >>> import tempfile
  >>> import pytz
  >>> from zope.component import getUtility
  >>> from canonical.database.sqlbase import ZopelessTransactionManager
  >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IScriptActivitySet

  >>> UTC = pytz.timezone('UTC')
  >>> ztm = ZopelessTransactionManager._installed

  >>> activity = getUtility(IScriptActivitySet).recordSuccess(
  ...     name='script-name',
  ...     date_started=datetime.datetime(2007,2,1,10,0,tzinfo=UTC),
  ...     date_completed=datetime.datetime(2007,2,1,10,1,tzinfo=UTC))

The activity object records the script name, the host name it ran on
and the start and end timestamps:

  >>> print activity.name
  script-name
  >>> activity.hostname == socket.gethostname()
  True
  >>> print activity.date_started
  2007-02-01 10:00:00+00:00
  >>> print activity.date_completed
  2007-02-01 10:01:00+00:00

We can also query for the last activity for a particular script, which
will match the activity we just created:

  >>> activity = getUtility(IScriptActivitySet).getLastActivity('script-name')
  >>> print activity.date_started
  2007-02-01 10:00:00+00:00


If no activity has occurred for a script, getLastActivity() returns
None:

  >>> print getUtility(IScriptActivitySet).getLastActivity('no-such-script')
  None


== LaunchpadScript Integration ==

A LaunchpadScript subclass is provided that will automatically log the
result of successful runs.  This is intended for use by cron scripts
and others where it is useful to monitor the result.

  >>> script_file = tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile()
  >>> script_file.write("""
  ... from canonical.launchpad.scripts.base import LaunchpadCronScript
  ... 
  ... class TestScript(LaunchpadCronScript):
  ...     def main(self):
  ...         # Fail if we are told to do so
  ...         if self.args[0] == 'fail':
  ...             raise RuntimeError('Some failure')
  ... 
  ... if __name__ == '__main__':
  ...     script = TestScript('test-script')
  ...     script.run()
  ... """)
  >>> script_file.flush()

We'll now run this script, telling it to fail:

  >>> ztm.commit()
  >>> env = dict(os.environ)
  >>> env['LPCONFIG'] = 'testrunner'
  >>> proc = subprocess.Popen([sys.executable, script_file.name, 'fail'],
  ...                         env=env, stdin=subprocess.PIPE,
  ...                         stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
  >>> (out, err) = proc.communicate()
  >>> ztm.abort()

The process failed:

  >>> print proc.returncode
  1

And no activity got recorded:

  >>> print getUtility(IScriptActivitySet).getLastActivity('test-script')
  None

If we run it such that it succeeds, we will get an activity record:

  >>> proc = subprocess.Popen([sys.executable, script_file.name, 'pass'],
  ...                         env=env, stdin=subprocess.PIPE,
  ...                         stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
  >>> (out, err) = proc.communicate()
  >>> ztm.abort()

  >>> print proc.returncode
  0
  >>> activity = getUtility(IScriptActivitySet).getLastActivity('test-script')
  >>> activity is not None
  True
  >>> print activity.name
  test-script
  >>> activity.hostname == socket.gethostname()
  True

Remove the temporary script file:

  >>> script_file.close()
