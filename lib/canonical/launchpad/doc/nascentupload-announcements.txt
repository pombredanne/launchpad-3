= NascentUpload Announcements =

NascentUpload announces uploads according its final status (NEW,
AUTO-APPROVED, UNAPPROVED) and its destination pocket:

 * NEW to RELEASE (via insecure): submitter set (changes signer,
   Changed-by and maintainer) receives an 'new' warning message.

 * UNAPPROVED to frozen-RELEASE/UPDATES/BACKPORTS/PROPOSED (via insecure):
   submitter set receives an 'unapproved' warning (announcement is
   sent after the upload gets reviewed by archive-admin at queue time).

 * AUTO-APPROVED to RELEASE (via insecure): submitter set receives an
   'acceptance' warning and the target distroseries changeslist
   address receives an 'announcement' message.

 * AUTO-APPROVED to BACKPORTS (via sync): submitter set receives an
   'acceptance' warning ('announcement' is skipped).

 * AUTO-APPROVED sources to SECURITY (via security): submitter set
   receives an 'acceptance' warning and the target distroseries
   changeslist address receives an 'announcement' message.

 * AUTO-APPROVED binaries to SECURITY (via security): submitter set
   receives only an 'acceptance' warning ('announcement' is skipped).

 * NEW, AUTO-APPROVED or UNAPPROVED source uploads targeted to section
   'translations' (all policies, all pockets) do not generate any
   messages. Remembering that NEW and UNAPPROVED messages are also
   suppressed in 'queue' application.

We need to be logged into the security model in order to get any further

  >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')

Helper functions to examine emails that were sent:

  >>> import email
  >>> from canonical.launchpad.mail import stub
  >>> def by_to_addrs(a, b):
  ...     return cmp(a[1], b[1])
  >>> from canonical.launchpad.tests.mail_helpers import pop_notifications

For the purpose of this test, hoary needs to be an open (development)
distroseries so that we can upload to it. Also adjust 'changeslist'
address:

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IDistributionSet
  >>> from canonical.lp.dbschema import DistroSeriesStatus
  >>> ubuntu = getUtility(IDistributionSet)['ubuntu']
  >>> hoary = ubuntu['hoary']
  >>> hoary.status = DistroSeriesStatus.DEVELOPMENT
  >>> hoary.changeslist = "hoary-announce@lists.ubuntu.com"

NEW source upload to RELEASE pocket via 'sync' policy (it presents
the same behaviour than using insecure policy, apart from allowing
unsigned changes):

  >>> from canonical.archiveuploader.nascentupload import NascentUpload
  >>> from canonical.archiveuploader.tests import (
  ...    datadir, getPolicy, mock_logger, mock_logger_quiet)

  >>> sync_policy = getPolicy(
  ...     name='sync', distro='ubuntu', distroseries='hoary')

  >>> netapplet_src = NascentUpload(
  ...     datadir('suite/bar_1.0-1/bar_1.0-1_source.changes'),
  ...     sync_policy, mock_logger_quiet)
  >>> netapplet_src.process()

  >>> netapplet_src.logger = mock_logger
  >>> result = netapplet_src.do_accept()
  DEBUG: Creating queue entry
  ...
  DEBUG: Sent a mail:

  DEBUG: NEW: bar_1.0-1.diff.gz
  DEBUG: NEW: bar_1.0-1.dsc
  ...
  DEBUG: above if files already exist in other distroseries.
  ...
  DEBUG: -- 
  DEBUG: You are receiving this email because you are the uploader, maintainer or
  DEBUG: signer of the above package.

There is only one email generated:

  >>> [notification] = pop_notifications()
  >>> notification['To']
  'Daniel Silverstone <daniel.silverstone@canonical.com>'

Let's ACCEPT bar sources in order to make the next uploads of this
series *known* in hoary:

  >>> netapplet_src.queue_root.setAccepted()
  >>> netapplet_src.queue_root.realiseUpload()

Make the uploaded orig file available to librarian lookups

  >>> import transaction
  >>> transaction.commit()

NEW binary upload to RELEASE pocket via 'sync' policy (we need to
override sync policy to allow binary uploads):

  >>> modified_sync_policy = getPolicy(
  ...     name='sync', distro='ubuntu', distroseries='hoary')
  >>> modified_sync_policy.can_upload_binaries = True

  >>> netapplet_src = NascentUpload(
  ...     datadir('suite/bar_1.0-1_binary/bar_1.0-1_i386.changes'),
  ...     modified_sync_policy, mock_logger_quiet)
  >>> netapplet_src.process()

  >>> netapplet_src.logger = mock_logger
  >>> result = netapplet_src.do_accept()
  DEBUG: Creating queue entry
  ...
  DEBUG: above if files already exist in other distroseries.
  ...
  DEBUG: -- 
  DEBUG: You are receiving this email because you are the uploader, maintainer or
  DEBUG: signer of the above package.

We simply ignore messages generated at this step because they are not
going to exist in production. We simply need this binary to be published
in order to test other features in post-release pockets.

   >>> ignore = pop_notifications()

Let's accept & publish bar binary in order to make the next uploads of
this series *known* in hoary:

  >>> netapplet_src.queue_root.setAccepted()
  >>> netapplet_src.queue_root.realiseUpload()


NEW source uploads for 'translations' section via sync policy:

  >>> modified_sync_policy = getPolicy(
  ...     name='sync', distro='ubuntu', distroseries='hoary')

  >>> lang_pack = NascentUpload(
  ...     datadir('language-packs/language-pack-pt_1.0-1_source.changes'),
  ...     modified_sync_policy, mock_logger_quiet)
  >>> lang_pack.process()

  >>> lang_pack.logger = mock_logger
  >>> result = lang_pack.do_accept()
  DEBUG: Creating queue entry
  DEBUG: Skipping acceptance and announcement, it is a language-package upload.

  >>> lang_pack.queue_root.status.name
  'NEW'

No messages were generated since this upload is targeted for the
'translation' section:

  >>> transaction.commit()
  >>> len(stub.test_emails)
  0

Accept and publish this series:

  >>> lang_pack.queue_root.setAccepted()
  >>> lang_pack.queue_root.realiseUpload()


AUTO_APPROVED source uploads for 'translations' section:

  >>> modified_sync_policy = getPolicy(
  ...     name='sync', distro='ubuntu', distroseries='hoary')

  >>> lang_pack = NascentUpload(
  ...     datadir('language-packs/language-pack-pt_1.0-2_source.changes'),
  ...     modified_sync_policy, mock_logger_quiet)
  >>> lang_pack.process()

  >>> lang_pack.logger = mock_logger
  >>> result = lang_pack.do_accept()
  DEBUG: Creating queue entry
  DEBUG: Setting it to ACCEPTED
  DEBUG: Skipping acceptance and announcement, it is a language-package upload.

  >>> lang_pack.queue_root.status.name
  'ACCEPTED'

Again, no messages were generated since this upload is targeted for
'translation' section:

  >>> transaction.commit()
  >>> len(stub.test_emails)
  0


Release hoary, enable uploads to post-release pockets:

  >>> hoary.status = DistroSeriesStatus.CURRENT


Import the test keys to use 'insecure' policy.

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests import import_public_test_keys
  >>> import_public_test_keys()


UNAPPROVED source uploads for 'translations' section via insecure:

  >>> insecure_policy = getPolicy(
  ...     name='insecure', distro='ubuntu', distroseries=None)
  >>> insecure_policy.setDistroSeriesAndPocket('hoary-updates')

  >>> lang_pack = NascentUpload(
  ...     datadir('language-packs/language-pack-pt_1.0-3_source.changes'),
  ...     insecure_policy, mock_logger_quiet)
  >>> lang_pack.process()

  >>> print lang_pack.rejection_message



  >>> lang_pack.logger = mock_logger
  >>> result = lang_pack.do_accept()
  DEBUG: Creating queue entry
  DEBUG: Setting it to UNAPPROVED
  DEBUG: Skipping acceptance and announcement, it is a language-package upload.

  >>> lang_pack.queue_root.status.name
  'UNAPPROVED'

UNAPPROVED message was also skipped for an upload targeted to
'translation' section:

  >>> transaction.commit()
  >>> len(stub.test_emails)
  0


AUTO-APPROVED upload to BACKPORTS pocket via 'sync' policy:

  >>> modified_sync_policy = getPolicy(

  >>> netapplet_src = NascentUpload(
  ...     datadir('suite/bar_1.0-4/bar_1.0-4_source.changes'),
