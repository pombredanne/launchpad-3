= Published Package =

This database view gives us information on which packages are published in
which distributions.

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IPublishedPackageSet
    >>> pp_set = getUtility(IPublishedPackageSet)

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.webapp.testing import verifyObject
    >>> verifyObject(IPublishedPackageSet, pp_set)
    True

There are also some meta objects to combine information from the DB
model in more intuitive ones:

 >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import SourcePackageRelease
 >>> src = SourcePackageRelease.get(20)
 >>> src.name
 u'pmount'

IDistroSeriesSourcePackageRelease.meta_binaries returns a list of binaries
resulting from the sourcepackagerelease for a distroseries.
This test makes sure that the meta_binaries method exists and the
returned objects meet the IDistroSeriesBinaryPackage interface.
There should only be one package in the binaries collection for
mozilla-firefox.  This is a feature of the sample data that we are relying
upon.

 >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IDistributionSet
 >>> ubuntu = getUtility(IDistributionSet)['ubuntu']
 >>> warty = ubuntu['warty']
 >>> ff_sp = warty.getSourcePackage('mozilla-firefox')
 >>> ff_drspr = ff_sp['0.9']
 >>> len(ff_drspr.meta_binaries)
 3

 >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IDistroSeriesBinaryPackage
 >>> verifyObject(IDistroSeriesBinaryPackage, ff_drspr.meta_binaries[0])
 True
