= Unicode CSV =

The Python library for supporting comma-separated value (CSV) files
does not support unicode.  In the examples section (9.1.5) of the
Python Libray documentation for version 2.5[1] they provide the code for
a UnicodeReader and UnicodeWriter.

In order to support direct reading of unicode into dictionaries, the
standard DictReader and DictWriter have been extended to be
UnicodeDictReader and UnicodeDictWriter.  These two classes are
identical to their base classes except for they utilize the
UnicodeReader and UnicodeWriter as their underlying workers.

== UnicodeCSVReader and UnicodeCSVWriter ==

    >>> from cStringIO import StringIO
    >>> from tempfile import mkstemp
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.utilities.unicode_csv import (
    ...     UnicodeCSVReader, UnicodeCSVWriter)

Create a test string with some non-ASCII content representing a row of
CSV data.

    >>> test_data = ["100", "A-101", u'La Pe\xf1a']
    >>> test_string = ','.join(test_data)
    >>> fd, fname = mkstemp()

The data cannot be written using the standard csv.writer class as it
raises a UnicodeEncodeError.

    >>> import csv
    >>> temp_file = open(fname, "wb")
    >>> writer = csv.writer(temp_file)
    >>> writer.writerow(test_data)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\xf1'...

Using the UnicodeWriter, write the single row to the temporary file.

    >>> temp_file = open(fname, "wb")
    >>> writer = UnicodeCSVWriter(temp_file, encoding="utf-8")
    >>> writer.writerow(test_data)
    >>> temp_file.close()

The data in the file has been converted to UTF-8.  If the file is read
in and compared to the original string they will not match due to the
encoding difference -- in fact, you can't even compare them as the
codec raises an error.

    >>> file_data = open(fname, "rb").readline()
    >>> file_data == test_string
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xc3...

The data is can be read back using the UnicodeCSVReader.

    >>> temp_file = open(fname, "rb")
    >>> reader = UnicodeCSVReader(temp_file, encoding="utf-8")
    >>> file_data = reader.next()
    >>> len(file_data)
    3

    >>> for orig, stored in zip(test_data, file_data):
    ...     orig == stored
    True
    True
    True

== UnicodeDictReader and UnicodeDictWriter ==

The dictionary-based versions of the unicode reader and writer work
exactly like the standard versions, they just take a dictionary as
input and present a dictionary as output as a convenience.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.utilities.unicode_csv import (
    ...     UnicodeDictReader, UnicodeDictWriter)

Construct a dict using the same data as before.

    >>> test_dict = dict(
    ...     id="100",
    ...     ext_id="A-101",
    ...     name=u'La Pe\xf1a')
    >>> fieldnames = test_dict.keys()
    >>> temp_file = open(fname, "wb")
    >>> writer = UnicodeDictWriter(
    ...    temp_file, fieldnames=fieldnames, encoding="utf-8")
    >>> writer.writerow(test_dict)
    >>> temp_file.close()

Read the dictionary back in using the UnicodeDictReader.

    >>> temp_file = open(fname, "rb")
    >>> reader = UnicodeDictReader(
    ...     temp_file, fieldnames=fieldnames, encoding="utf-8")
    >>> read_dict = reader.next()
    >>> len(read_dict)
    3

    >>> for key in fieldnames:
    ...     test_dict[key] == read_dict[key]
    True
    True
    True

    >>> temp_file.close()
    >>> import os
    >>> os.unlink(fname)
