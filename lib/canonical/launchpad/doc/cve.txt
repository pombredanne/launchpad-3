= Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) =

Malone supports attaching CVE references to bugs. From
http://www.cve.mitre.org/about/ CVE is:

    A list of standardized names for vulnerabilities and other
    information security exposures - CVE aims to standardize the names
    for all publicly known vulnerabilities and security exposures.

For more information, consult the CVE website:

    http://www.cve.mitre.org/

== CveSet ==

The ICveSet utility is used to create and get CVEs and BugCves.

=== Creating CVE entries ===

CVE references can be created with the ICveSet utility.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests import login
    >>> login("test@canonical.com")

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import ICveSet
    >>> from canonical.lp.dbschema import CveStatus
    >>> cveset = getUtility(ICveSet)

To create a CVE, call ICveSet.new(sequence, description,
    status=CveStatus.CANDIDATE)

    >>> cve = cveset.new(sequence="2004-0276",
    ...     description="A new CVE", status=CveStatus.ENTRY,
    ...     )
    >>> cve.displayname
    u'CVE-2004-0276'

=== Number of CVE links ===

We can get the number of CVE links to bugs in Launchpad using
getBugCveCount.

    >>> cveset.getBugCveCount()
    2

If we add another link, the count will of course increase by one.  The
supplied user is the person linking the CVEs.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IBugSet, IPersonSet
    >>> no_priv = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('no-priv')
    >>> bug_one = getUtility(IBugSet).get(1)
    >>> bug_one.linkCVE(cve, user=no_priv)
    <BugCve at ...>

    >>> cveset.getBugCveCount()
    3

And if we unlink it, the count will decrease.

    >>> bug_one.unlinkCVE(cve)

    >>> cveset.getBugCveCount()
    2

== Linking CVEs to Bugs ==

You can link a CVE to a bug. You can also see which CVEs are currently
linked to a bug:

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import Bug
    >>> b = Bug.get(1)
    >>> for c in b.cves:
    ...     print c.displayname
    CVE-1999-8979

Let's add the new CVE:

    >>> b.cves.count()
    1
    >>> b.linkCVE(cve, no_priv)
    <BugCve at ...>
    >>> b.cves.count()
    2

Ah, but that was a bad idea. Let's unlink it.

    >>> b.unlinkCVE(cve)
    >>> b.cves.count()
    1

Alternatively, we can link CVEs to bugs by looking for CVEs in a
string of text. The supplied user is the person linking the CVEs.

    >>> b.findCvesInText('''
    ...     This bug is related to CVE-2004-0276
    ... ''', user=no_priv)
    >>> cve in b.cves
    True
    >>> b.unlinkCVE(cve)

== CVE Reports ==

Launchpad offers distributions, distribution releases and products with
reports that inform on the status of bugs related to CVEs in the
distribution. The method that drives this report is
ICveSet.getBugCvesForBugTasks:

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import BugTaskSearchParams
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import Distribution
    >>> params = BugTaskSearchParams(None)
    >>> ubuntu = Distribution.selectOneBy(name="ubuntu")
    >>> ubuntu_tasks = ubuntu.searchTasks(params)
    >>> bugcves = cveset.getBugCvesForBugTasks(ubuntu_tasks)
    >>> [(bugcve.bug.id, bugcve.cve.title) for bugcve in bugcves]
    [(1, u'CVE-1999-8979 (Entry)'),
     (2, u'CVE-1999-2345 (Candidate)')]

This method is used in the CVEReportView:

    >>> from zope.component import getView
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.webapp.servers import LaunchpadTestRequest
    >>> request = LaunchpadTestRequest()
    >>> cve_report = getView(ubuntu, "+cve", request)
    >>> cve_report.initialize()

This view has a pair of methods that constructs a data structure that
connects bugs to bugtasks and CVEs. The open_cve_bugtasks returned are, not
surprisingly, the same the method above returned:

    >>> for bugtaskcve in cve_report.open_cve_bugtasks:
    ...    ([bugtask.title for bugtask in bugtaskcve.bugtasks],
    ...     [cve.title for cve in bugtaskcve.cves])
    ([u'Bug #1 in mozilla-firefox (Ubuntu): "Firefox does not support SVG"'],
     [u'CVE-1999-8979 (Entry)'])
    ([u'Bug #2 in Ubuntu: "Blackhole Trash folder"'],
     [u'CVE-1999-2345 (Candidate)'])

There are no resolved bugtasks linked to CVEs in Ubuntu:

    >>> cve_report.resolved_cve_bugtasks
    []
