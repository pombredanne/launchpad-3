= Branch merge proposals =

Branch merge proposals are a way to show intent of one branch to land
code on another branch.  The database object is called a merge proposal
as it has a source branch and a target branch, but when looking at
branch merge proposals through the UI we are looking from a particular
context, and as such they are referred to as landing targets or landing
candidates.

  Landing Targets - these are the branches (or the merge proposals) for
  which the branch that is being looked at is the source branch.  It is
  called that due to the idea that the target branch is where the code
  intentds to 'land' or 'merge'.

  Landing Candidates - these are the branches (or the merge proposals)
  that want to land on the branch being looked at.

Branch merge proposals are created by calling the `addLandingTarget`
method on a branch.  Junk branches cannot have landing targets.

  * The target branch and dependent branch (if it has one) must both
    have the same product as the source branch.

  * There must not already exist a branch merge proposal for the source
    branch and target branch pair.


== Registering a landing target ==

All merge proposals have to be registered by a Person.

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import (
    ...     IBranchSet, IPersonSet)
    >>> person_set = getUtility(IPersonSet)
    >>> login('test@canonical.com')
    >>> sample_person = person_set.getByEmail('test@canonical.com')
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.testing import time_counter
    >>> now = time_counter()

In order to register a merge proposal there has to be a source branch
and a target branch.

    >>> branch_set = getUtility(IBranchSet)
    >>> source_branch = branch_set.getByUniqueName(
    ...     '~name12/gnome-terminal/klingon')
    >>> target_branch = branch_set.getByUniqueName(
    ...     '~name12/gnome-terminal/main')
    >>> scanned_branch = branch_set.getByUniqueName(
    ...     '~name12/gnome-terminal/scanned')

    >>> merge_proposal = source_branch.addLandingTarget(
    ...     sample_person, target_branch, dependent_branch=scanned_branch,
    ...     date_created=now.next())

This merge proposal is now listing against both the source and target
branches.

    >>> for proposal in source_branch.landing_targets:
    ...     print proposal.target_branch.unique_name
    ~name12/gnome-terminal/main

    >>> for proposal in target_branch.landing_candidates:
    ...     print proposal.source_branch.unique_name
    ~name12/gnome-terminal/klingon

All the code paths through `addLandingTarget` are exercised by the UnitTest
canonical.launchpad.database.tests.test_branch.BranchAddLandingTarget.

In normal project circumstances there will normally be only one landing
target registered for any given branch.  Sometimes there may be two or more
specified but that would be in the situation where a single patch or fix
is going to land on multiple supported branches.  It is often desirable to
see the landing target information even after the merge has taken place.

In comparison though, a trunk branch will have a significant number of
merge candidates.  From the target branch point of view, it is normally
only the source branches where the proposals are not in one of the
terminal states (merged, rejected, superseded) that are of interest.
The landing_candidates only returns unmerged proposals, with the most
recent branch merge proposals first.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.testing import LaunchpadObjectFactory
    >>> factory = LaunchpadObjectFactory()
    >>> proposal = factory.makeBranchMergeProposal(
    ...     target_branch=target_branch, dependent_branch=scanned_branch)
    >>> proposal = proposal.resubmit(proposal.registrant)
    >>> proposal.rejectBranch(sample_person, 'some-revision')
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import (
    ...     BranchMergeProposalStatus)
    >>> proposal = factory.makeBranchMergeProposal(
    ...     target_branch=target_branch, dependent_branch=scanned_branch,
    ...     set_state=BranchMergeProposalStatus.MERGED)

    >>> branch = branch_set.getByUniqueName(
    ...     '~launchpad/gnome-terminal/launchpad')
    >>> proposal = branch.addLandingTarget(
    ...     sample_person, target_branch, dependent_branch=scanned_branch,
    ...     date_created=now.next())

    >>> flush_database_updates()
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.database.branchmergeproposal import (
    ...     BranchMergeProposal)
    >>> for proposal in BranchMergeProposal.selectBy(
    ...     target_branch=target_branch):
    ...     print proposal.queue_status.title
    Work in progress
    Work in progress
    Superseded
    Rejected
    Merged

    >>> for proposal in target_branch.landing_candidates:
    ...     print proposal.queue_status.title
    Work in progress
    Work in progress

    >>> for proposal in BranchMergeProposal.selectBy(
    ...     dependent_branch=scanned_branch):
    ...     print proposal.queue_status.title
    Work in progress
    Work in progress
    Superseded
    Rejected
    Merged

    >>> for proposal in scanned_branch.dependent_branches:
    ...     print proposal.queue_status.title
    Work in progress
    Work in progress


== Merge proposal states ==

A branch merge proposal can be in one of several states:

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import BranchMergeProposalStatus
    >>> for state in BranchMergeProposalStatus:
    ...     print state.title
    Work in progress
    Needs review
    Code approved
    Rejected
    Merged
    Code failed to merge
    Queued
    Superseded

When a merge proposal is initially created, it is in the "Work in
progress" state.  The only state that is a final state is "Merged".

    >>> source_branch = factory.makeBranch(owner=sample_person)
    >>> # Needs to be the same product to merge into.
    >>> target_branch = factory.makeBranch(
    ...     owner=sample_person, product=source_branch.product)
    >>> proposal = source_branch.addLandingTarget(
    ...     sample_person, target_branch, date_created=now.next())
    >>> print proposal.queue_status.title
    Work in progress

Adjusting the state is done through methods on the merge proposal.

    >>> print proposal.date_review_requested
    None
    >>> proposal.requestReview()
    >>> print proposal.queue_status.title
    Needs review

When requesting a review, a timestamp is also recorded.

    >>> proposal.date_review_requested is not None
    True

Directly setting the queue_status is not possible.

    >>> proposal.queue_status = BranchMergeProposalStatus.CODE_APPROVED
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ForbiddenAttribute: ('queue_status', <BranchMergeProposal at ...>)


=== Approving or rejecting code ===

Once code has been reviewed the result of the code review can be
recorded either as approved or not approved.

There is a limited number of people that are able to make code as
approved or not.  By default the owner of the target branch can sign-off
code. If the target branch has specified a review team, then we use that
to control who can sign-off code.

Initially both the reviewer and date_reviewed for a merge proposal
are not set.

    >>> print proposal.reviewer
    None
    >>> print proposal.date_reviewed
    None

Since Sample Person is the owner of the target branch they can authorise
their own code.

When approving code the revision id is recorded as the last approved
revision.  This is to record that the reviewer has approved up to a
particular revision, and that subsequent revsions added by the branch
author have not been approved.

    >>> def add_some_revisions_to_branch(branch, factory, branch_set):
    ...     # Revisions can only be added by the scanner, so switch dbuser.
    ...     from canonical.database.sqlbase import commit
    ...     from canonical.testing import LaunchpadZopelessLayer
    ...     from canonical.config import config
    ...     branch_unique_name = branch.unique_name
    ...     launchpad_dbuser = config.launchpad.dbuser
    ...     commit()
    ...     LaunchpadZopelessLayer.switchDbUser(config.branchscanner.dbuser)
    ...     branch = branch_set.getByUniqueName(branch_unique_name)
    ...     factory.makeRevisionsForBranch(branch)
    ...     commit()
    ...     LaunchpadZopelessLayer.switchDbUser(launchpad_dbuser)
    ...     return branch_set.getByUniqueName(branch_unique_name)
    >>> source_branch = add_some_revisions_to_branch(
    ...     source_branch, factory, branch_set)
    >>> proposal = source_branch.landing_targets[0]
    >>> source_branch.revision_count
    5

As we've reset the database adapter, we need to reget some objects:

    >>> sample_person = person_set.getByEmail('test@canonical.com')
    >>> branch = branch_set.getByUniqueName(
    ...     '~launchpad/gnome-terminal/launchpad')


    >>> tip = source_branch.getTipRevision()
    >>> proposal.approveBranch(sample_person, tip.revision_id)
    >>> print proposal.reviewer.displayname
    Sample Person
    >>> proposal.date_reviewed is not None
    True
    >>> print proposal.queue_status.title
    Code approved
    >>> proposal.reviewed_revision_id == tip.revision_id
    True

Code that has been accepted can also be set to rejected.  Rejected
branches also record the revision that was rejected.

    >>> proposal.rejectBranch(sample_person, tip.revision_id)
    >>> print proposal.queue_status.title
    Rejected
    >>> proposal.reviewed_revision_id == tip.revision_id
    True

Rejected proposals cannot be approved again.  They must be resubmitted
(see below).

    >>> proposal.approveBranch(sample_person, tip.revision_id)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    BadStateTransition: Invalid state transition for merge proposal:
      Rejected -> Code approved

Proposals that are `Code approved` can be moved back into the
`Needs review` state.

    >>> proposal = proposal.resubmit(sample_person)
    >>> proposal.approveBranch(sample_person, tip.revision_id)
    >>> print proposal.queue_status.title
    Code approved
    >>> proposal.requestReview()
    >>> print proposal.queue_status.title
    Needs review

Branches that had been approved that have subsequently been
set back into the needs review state still retain their old reviewed
revision id.

    >>> proposal.reviewed_revision_id == tip.revision_id
    True

If the target branch has specified a specific reviewer, then only
a user in the reviewer team can approve or reject the branch.

    >>> eric_the_reviewer = factory.makePerson(name="eric-reviewer")
    >>> target_branch = proposal.target_branch
    >>> target_branch.reviewer = eric_the_reviewer
    >>> proposal.rejectBranch(sample_person, tip.revision_id)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    UserNotBranchReviewer
    >>> proposal.approveBranch(sample_person, tip.revision_id)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    UserNotBranchReviewer

    >>> proposal.approveBranch(eric_the_reviewer, tip.revision_id)
    >>> print proposal.queue_status.title
    Code approved


== Queueing up a branch that has been approved ==

A branch proposal to merge that has been approved can be added to the
merge queue for the target branch.  The proposal to merge will be given
a queue position which has no significance other than defining the
order in the queue.  There can be no assumptions on the actual value
of the queue position as any integer value is valid, and a smaller
integer value comes before a larger integer value in the queue.

When a proposal is queued, the person that queues up the branch is
recorded, along with the revision_id of the tip revision.  This revision_id
is the revision that will be merged into the target branch.

    >>> proposal.enqueue(sample_person, tip.revision_id)
    >>> print proposal.queue_status.title
    Queued
    >>> print proposal.queuer.displayname
    Sample Person
    >>> proposal.queued_revision_id == tip.revision_id
    True
    >>> proposal.queue_position is not None
    True


== Removing a branch from the merge queue ==

A branch proposal to merge that has been queued can also be removed
from the queue.  Doing so moves the state of the proposal back to
Approved.

    >>> proposal.dequeue()
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests import syncUpdate
    >>> syncUpdate(proposal)
    >>> print proposal.queue_status.title
    Code approved
    >>> print proposal.queue_position
    None
    >>> print proposal.queuer
    None


== Transitioning through code approved when queueing ==

If the proposal to merge was not in the approved state before attempting
to queue the branch, then an implicit approval is attempted.  If the user
queueing the branch is not a reviewer, an exception is raised.

    >>> proposal.requestReview()
    >>> print proposal.queue_status.title
    Needs review

    >>> proposal.enqueue(sample_person, tip.revision_id)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    UserNotBranchReviewer

    >>> proposal.enqueue(eric_the_reviewer, tip.revision_id)
    >>> print proposal.queue_status.title
    Queued
    >>> print proposal.queuer.name
    eric-reviewer
    >>> print proposal.reviewer.name
    eric-reviewer


== Marking as failed to merge ==

Anyone that has rights to edit the merge proposal can say that the
merge failed.

    >>> proposal.mergeFailed(merger=sample_person)
    >>> print proposal.queue_status.title
    Code failed to merge

Proposals that are in the "Code failed to merge" state can be set back
to any other state.

    >>> proposal.setAsWorkInProgress()
    >>> print proposal.queue_status.title
    Work in progress


== Getting a list of previous merge targets ==

In order to make it easier to propose branches to merge on similar
branches, there is a method on the branch set that returns the branches that a
user has previously targetted for merging.

    >>> gnome_terminal = branch.product
    >>> branches = branch_set.getTargetBranchesForUsersMergeProposals(
    ...     sample_person, gnome_terminal)
    >>> for branch in branches:
    ...     print branch.unique_name
    ~name12/gnome-terminal/main


== Marking as merged ==

A merge proposal may be marked as merged by calling the `markAsMerged` method
on the `BranchMergeProposal`.

If a revision number is supplied, the method looks for a `BranchRevision` in
the target branch that matches.  If one is found then the revision date from
the associated `Revision` is used as the merge date.  This allows branches
that are not necessarily available to launchpad to manually mark the merge
proposals as merged.

The user that marked the branch as merged can also be recorded.

    >>> branch = branch_set.getByUniqueName(
    ...     '~launchpad/gnome-terminal/launchpad')
    >>> merge_proposal = branch.landing_targets[0]
    >>> reporter = person_set.getByName('sabdfl')
    >>> merge_proposal.markAsMerged(1234, now.next(), reporter)
    >>> merge_proposal.merged_revno
    1234
    >>> print merge_proposal.merge_reporter.browsername
    Mark Shuttleworth
    >>> print merge_proposal.queue_status.title
    Merged
    >>> flush_database_updates()

The merged proposal is no longer listed amongst the target's candidates.

    >>> print merge_proposal.source_branch.unique_name
    ~launchpad/gnome-terminal/launchpad
    >>> for proposal in merge_proposal.target_branch.landing_candidates:
    ...     print proposal.source_branch.unique_name
    ~name12/gnome-terminal/klingon

But the merge proposal is still listed in the source's targets.

    >>> for proposal in merge_proposal.source_branch.landing_targets:
    ...     print proposal.target_branch.unique_name
    ~name12/gnome-terminal/main

The firefox branches are the branches that are attached to a product
and have revisions (well, a revision).

    >>> source_branch = branch_set.getByUniqueName(
    ...     '~sabdfl/firefox/release-0.9')
    >>> target_branch = branch_set.getByUniqueName(
    ...     '~sabdfl/firefox/release-0.9.2')
    >>> merge_proposal = source_branch.addLandingTarget(
    ...     sample_person, target_branch, date_created=now.next())

The target branch has a revision 1, so the merge time is taken form
that revision.

    >>> history = list(target_branch.revision_history)
    >>> branch_revision = history[0]
    >>> branch_revision.sequence
    1
    >>> print branch_revision.revision.revision_date
    2005-03-09 15:40:00+00:00

    >>> merge_proposal.markAsMerged(1, now.next(), reporter)
    >>> print merge_proposal.date_merged
    2005-03-09 15:40:00+00:00
    >>> print merge_proposal.merge_reporter.browsername
    Mark Shuttleworth


== Interfaces ==

The BranchMergeProposal must implement the IBranchMergeProposal interface.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.webapp.testing import verifyObject
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IBranchMergeProposal
    >>> verifyObject(IBranchMergeProposal, merge_proposal)
    True


== Canonical URL ==

The URL of a branch merge proposal is based on the source branch.
In order to keep the URL managable, the database ID of the merge
proposal is used.

    >>> login('test@canonical.com')
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.webapp import canonical_url
    >>> merge_proposal = source_branch.landing_targets[0]
    >>> url = canonical_url(merge_proposal)
    >>> url[url.rfind('/')+1:] == str(merge_proposal.id)
    True
    >>> print url
    http://code.launchpad.dev/~sabdfl/firefox/release-0.9/+merge/...


== Deleting merge proposals ==

Deleting merge proposals is done using the deleteProposal() method on
the merge proposal itself.  The `deleteProposal` method is protected by
launchpad.Edit, which restricts access to the owner of the source
branch, the owner of the target branch, or the registrant (and LP
admins).

    >>> source_branch.landing_targets.count()
    1
    >>> merge_proposal = source_branch.landing_targets[0]
    >>> login('no-priv@canonical.com')
    >>> merge_proposal.deleteProposal()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    Unauthorized: (<BranchMergeProposal ...>,
    'deleteProposal', 'launchpad.Edit')

Sample Person is the registrant, so they can delete it.

    >>> login('test@canonical.com')
    >>> merge_proposal.deleteProposal()
    >>> source_branch.landing_targets.count()
    0


== Resubmitting merge proposals ==

If a proposal has been rejected, the proposal can be resubmitted
(normally after the branch author has fixed the problems).  When a
proposal is resubmitted the original proposal is marked as SUPERSEDED
and a new proposal is created which has the same details as the
original.  The new proposal has an attribute called
`supersedes` which is the proposal it superseded (i.e. the
original proposal).  The original proposal also has an attribute
`superseded_by` which is the proposal that supersedes it (i.e. the
new proposal).

    >>> proposal = factory.makeBranchMergeProposal(registrant=sample_person)
    >>> proposal.rejectBranch(proposal.target_branch.owner, 'some-revision')
    >>> print proposal.queue_status.title
    Rejected

    >>> new_proposal = proposal.resubmit(sample_person)
    >>> print new_proposal.queue_status.title
    Work in progress
    >>> new_proposal == proposal
    False
    >>> new_proposal.supersedes == proposal
    True
    >>> flush_database_updates()
    >>> proposal.superseded_by == new_proposal
    True

If the new proposal is deleted, the old proposal stays in the
superseded state, but no longer has a `superseded_by` proposal.

    >>> new_proposal.deleteProposal()
    >>> print proposal.queue_status.title
    Superseded
    >>> print proposal.superseded_by
    None

If the old proposal is deleted, the new proposal no longer shows
the supersedes.

    >>> proposal = factory.makeBranchMergeProposal(registrant=sample_person)
    >>> new_proposal = proposal.resubmit(sample_person)
    >>> new_proposal.supersedes == proposal
    True

    >>> flush_database_updates()
    >>> proposal.deleteProposal()
    >>> print new_proposal.supersedes
    None

If there is a chain of superseded proposals, and the one in the middle
is deleted, then the chain is just made shorter.

    >>> original = factory.makeBranchMergeProposal(registrant=sample_person)
    >>> middle = original.resubmit(sample_person)
    >>> last = middle.resubmit(sample_person)
    >>> flush_database_updates()

    >>> original.superseded_by == middle
    True
    >>> middle.supersedes == original
    True
    >>> middle.superseded_by == last
    True
    >>> last.supersedes == middle
    True

    >>> middle.deleteProposal()

    >>> original.superseded_by == last
    True
    >>> last.supersedes == original
    True
