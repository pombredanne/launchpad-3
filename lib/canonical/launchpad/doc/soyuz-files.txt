= Soyuz Files =

Soyuz keeps a collection of source and binary packages classified as
SourcePackageRelease and BinaryPackageRelease respectively, each of
those records may contain one or more files according its type.

Those files are stored in the Librarian and related to their parent
object via a BinaryPackageFile or SourcePackageReleaseFile.

SourcePackageReleaseFile or BinaryPackageFile are available via the
'files' attribute on its parent.

 >>> from canonical.launchpad.webapp.testing import verifyObject
 >>> from zope.component import getUtility

 >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import (
 ...    IDistributionSet, ILibraryFileAlias,
 ...    ISourcePackageReleaseFile, IBinaryPackageFile)

 >>> warty = getUtility(IDistributionSet)['ubuntu']['warty']


== Source Files ==

An ISourcePackageRelease contains the file that make up the source
package for that release:

   * An '.orig.tar.gz' file containing the upstream source distribution.
   * A '.diff.tar.gz' file containing the patches applied to the
     upstream source.
   * A '.dsc' package description file.

 >>> warty_firefox_srcpkg = warty.getSourcePackage(
 ...     'mozilla-firefox').currentrelease

 >>> srcfile = warty_firefox_srcpkg.files[0]

 >>> verifyObject(ISourcePackageReleaseFile, srcfile)
 True

 >>> verifyObject(ILibraryFileAlias, srcfile.libraryfile)
 True

 >>> srcfile.libraryfile.filename
 u'firefox-0.9.2.orig.tar.gz'

 >>> srcfile.libraryfile.http_url
 'http://localhost:58000/3/firefox-0.9.2.orig.tar.gz'


== Binary Files ==

An IBinaryPackageRelease contains only one file which is the
instalable debian-format file:

   * An '.deb'

 >>> warty_i386_pmount_binpkg = warty['i386'].getBinaryPackage(
 ...    'pmount').currentrelease

 >>> warty_i386_pmount_binpkg.name
 u'pmount'

 >>> debfile = warty_i386_pmount_binpkg.files[0]

 >>> verifyObject(IBinaryPackageFile, debfile)
 True

 >>> verifyObject(ILibraryFileAlias, debfile.libraryfile)
 True

 >>> debfile.libraryfile.filename
 u'pmount_1.9-1_all.deb'

 >>> debfile.libraryfile.http_url
 'http://localhost:58000/37/pmount_1.9-1_all.deb'


== Utilities ==

There is a utility class IBinaryPackageFileSet that will return
BinaryPackageFile records.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces.files import (
    ...     IBinaryPackageFileSet)
    >>> file_set = getUtility(IBinaryPackageFileSet)

It only contains one method, getByPackageUploadIDs(), that will return
all the BinaryPackageFiles that are associated with the supplied
PackageUpload IDs.

    >>> ids = (2,)
    >>> binary_package_files = file_set.getByPackageUploadIDs(ids)
    >>> for binary_package_file in binary_package_files:
    ...     print binary_package_file.libraryfile.filename
    pmount_1.0-1_all.deb

Additional IDs may also be passed and if they don't have any
BinaryPackageFiles they are ignored and don't affect the results.

    >>> ids = (1,2,3,4,5)
    >>> binary_package_files = file_set.getByPackageUploadIDs(ids)
    >>> for binary_package_file in binary_package_files:
    ...     print binary_package_file.libraryfile.filename
    pmount_1.0-1_all.deb
