= Mail notifications for membership changes =

Whenever a membership status is changed, we should notify the team admins and
the member whose membership changed. There's a few cases where we might want
to notify only the team admins, but in most of the cases we'll be sending two
similar (but not identical) notifications: one for all team admins and another
for the member.

    >>> def by_to_addrs(a, b):
    ...     return cmp(a[1], b[1])

    >>> def setStatus(membership, status, reviewer=None, comment=None):
    ...     """Set the status of the given membership.
    ...
    ...     Also sets the reviewer and comment, calling flush_database_updates
    ...     and transaction.commit after, to ensure the changes are flushed to
    ...     the database.
    ...     """
    ...     membership.setStatus(
    ...         status, reviewer=reviewer, reviewercomment=comment)
    ...     flush_database_updates()
    ...     transaction.commit()

    >>> import email
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.mail import stub
    >>> def pop_notifications():
    ...     stub.test_emails.sort(by_to_addrs)
    ...     notifications = [
    ...         email.message_from_string(raw_message)
    ...         for fromaddr, toaddrs, raw_message in stub.test_emails]
    ...     stub.test_emails = []
    ...     return notifications

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility

Now Robert Collins proposes himself as a member of the Ubuntu Team. This
generates a notification email only to Ubuntu Team administrators.

    Robert Collins (lifeless) wants to be a member of Ubuntu Team (ubuntu-

== Adding new members ==

When a person is added as a member of a team by one of that team's
administrators, an email is sent to all team administrators and to the new
member.

    >>> cprov = personset.getByName('cprov')
    >>> marilize = personset.getByName('marilize')
    >>> ubuntu_team.addMember(marilize, reviewer=cprov)
    >>> transaction.commit()

By default, if the newly added member is actually a team, we'll only send
an invitation to the team's admins, telling them that the membership will
only be activated if they accept the invitation.

    >>> mirror_admins = personset.getByName('ubuntu-mirror-admins')
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.helpers import contactEmailAddresses
    >>> mirror_admins.getTeamAdminsEmailAddresses()

    >>> [notification] = pop_notifications()
    >>> print notification['To']
    mark@hbd.com
    >>> print notification.get_payload() #doctest: -NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    Hello,

    The Launchpad team
    
If one of the admins accept the invitation, then a notification is sent to the
team which just became a member and to the admins of the hosting team.

    >>> comment = "Of course I want to be part of ubuntu!"
    >>> mirror_admins.acceptInvitationToBeMemberOf(ubuntu_team, comment)

Similarly, a notification is sent if the invitation is declined.

    >>> landscape = personset.getByName('landscape-developers')
    >>> ubuntu_team.addMember(landscape, reviewer=cprov)

    # Reset stub.test_emails as we don't care about the notification triggered

It's also possible to forcibly add a team as a member of another one, by
passing force_team_add=True to the addMember() method.

== Membership expiration warnings ==

When we get close to the expiration date of a given membership, an expiration
warning is sent to the member, so that he can contact the team's
administrators (or renew it himself when he has necessary rights) in case
he wants to retain that membership. This is done by the
flag-expired-memberships cronscript, which uses
ITeamMembership.sendExpirationWarningEmail to do its job.

    >>> import pytz
    >>> from datetime import datetime, timedelta
    >>> utc_now = datetime.now(pytz.timezone('UTC'))
    >>> kamion_on_ubuntu_team = membershipset.getByPersonAndTeam(
    ...     kamion, ubuntu_team)
    >>> kamion_on_ubuntu_team.setExpirationDate(
    ...     utc_now + timedelta(days=9), sabdfl)
    >>> flush_database_updates()

Kamion is an admin of the Ubuntu team, but team admins can't change the
expiration date of their own memberships, so he still has to contact one of
the other team admins.

    >>> kamion_on_ubuntu_team.status.name
    'ADMIN' 
    >>> kamion_on_ubuntu_team.sendExpirationWarningEmail()
    >>> transaction.commit()

In the case of the beta-testers team, the email is sent only to the

If the team's renewal policy is NONE but the member has the necessary rights
to change the expiration date of his own membership (i.e. by being the team's

where he can extend it.

== Membership expiration notification ==

For teams with a renewal policy other than AUTOMATIC, if a membership is not
renewed before its expiration date it'll be flagged as expired and a
notification is sent to the team admins and to the member whose membership
expired. If the renewal policy is AUTOMATIC, though, the memberships that
should expire will retain their status and have their dateexpires update. A
notification is also sent to the member and to team admins when a membership
is automatically renewed.

    >>> from zope.security.proxy import removeSecurityProxy
    >>> utc_now = datetime.now(pytz.timezone('UTC'))
    >>> lp_admins = personset.getByName('admins')
    >>> print lp_admins.renewal_policy.title
    invite them to apply for renewal

    >>> sabdfl_on_admins = membershipset.getByPersonAndTeam(sabdfl, lp_admins)

    # Need to cheat here and set the expiry date manually because the expiry
    # date given to setExpirationDate() must be in the future.
    >>> removeSecurityProxy(sabdfl_on_admins).dateexpires = utc_now

    >>> ubuntu_team = personset.getByName('ubuntu-team')

The expiration/auto-renewal notifications are sent to each person
individually rather than sending a single email to everybody, so we'll
just show the recipients and the different messages we may send.

== Memberships renewed by the members themselves ==

Another possible renewal policy for teams is ONDEMAND, which means that team
members are invited to renew their membership once it gets close to their
expiration date. When a member renew his own membership, a notification is
sent to all team admins.

    >>> karl = personset.getByName('karl')
    >>> mirror_admins = personset.getByName('ubuntu-mirror-admins')
    >>> karl_on_mirroradmins = membershipset.getByPersonAndTeam(
    ...     karl, mirror_admins)
    >>> tomorrow = datetime.now(pytz.timezone('UTC')) + timedelta(days=1)
    >>> print karl_on_mirroradmins.status.title
    Approved
    >>> print karl_on_mirroradmins.dateexpires
    None

    >>> login(mirror_admins.teamowner.preferredemail.email)
    >>> karl_on_mirroradmins.setExpirationDate(
    ...     tomorrow, mirror_admins.teamowner)
    >>> ondemand = TeamMembershipRenewalPolicy.ONDEMAND
    >>> karl_on_mirroradmins.team.renewal_policy = ondemand
    >>> mirror_admins.defaultrenewalperiod = 365
    >>> flush_database_updates()

    >>> login(karl.preferredemail.email)
    >>> karl.renewTeamMembership(mirror_admins)
    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> len(stub.test_emails)
    1

    >>> print_distinct_messages_and_recipients()
    From: Mirror Administrators <noreply@launchpad.net>
    To: mark@hbd.com
    Subject: karl extended their membership
    Hello Mark Shuttleworth,
    <BLANKLINE>
    Karl Tilbury (karl) renewed their own membership in the Mirror
    Administrators (ubuntu-mirror-admins) team until ...
    <BLANKLINE>
    Regards,
    The Launchpad team
    ----------------------------------------

== Some special cases ==

When creating a new team, the owner has his membership's status changed from
approved to admin, but he won't get a notification of that.

    >>> team = personset.newTeam(sabdfl, 'testteam', 'Test')
    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> len(stub.test_emails)
    0

    # Other tests expect an empty stub.test_emails, but if this one above
    # fails, I don't want a non-empty stub.test_emails to cause the tests
    # below to fail too.
    >>> stub.test_emails = []

If cprov is made an administrator of ubuntu_team, he'll only get one email
notification.

    >>> cprov = personset.getByName('cprov')
    >>> cprov_membership = membershipset.getByPersonAndTeam(cprov, ubuntu_team)
    >>> login('mark@hbd.com')
    >>> setStatus(
    ...     cprov_membership, TeamMembershipStatus.ADMIN, reviewer=sabdfl)
    >>> len(stub.test_emails)
    2
    >>> member_notification, admins_notification = pop_notifications()
    >>> print admins_notification['To']
    colin.watson@ubuntulinux.com, foo.bar@canonical.com,
    jeff.waugh@ubuntulinux.com, mark@hbd.com
    >>> member_notification['To']
    'celso.providelo@canonical.com'

If a team admin changes his own membership, the notification sent will clearly
say that the change was performed by the user himself, and it will only be
sent to the team administrators.

    >>> jdub = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('jdub')
    >>> jdub_membership = membershipset.getByPersonAndTeam(jdub, ubuntu_team)
    >>> setStatus(jdub_membership, TeamMembershipStatus.APPROVED,
    ...           reviewer=jdub)
    >>> len(stub.test_emails)
    1
    >>> [admins_notification] = pop_notifications()
    >>> print admins_notification['To']
    celso.providelo@canonical.com, colin.watson@ubuntulinux.com,
    foo.bar@canonical.com, mark@hbd.com
    >>> admins_notification['Subject']
    'Launchpad: Membership change: jdub in ubuntu-team'
    >>> print admins_notification.get_payload() #doctest: -NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    Hello,
    <BLANKLINE>
    The membership status of Jeff Waugh (jdub) in the team Ubuntu Team
    (ubuntu-team) was changed by the user himself from Administrator to
    Approved.


Deactivating the membership of a team also generates notifications for the
team which had the membership deactivated and to the administrators of the
hosting team. Note that the notification sent to the team whose membership
was deactivated will not talk about "your membership" as it wouldn't make
sense to the members of the team reading it.

    >>> mirror_admins_membership = membershipset.getByPersonAndTeam(
    ...     mirror_admins, ubuntu_team)
    >>> setStatus(mirror_admins_membership, TeamMembershipStatus.DEACTIVATED,
    ...           reviewer=sabdfl)
    >>> len(stub.test_emails)
    2
    >>> member_notification, admins_notification = pop_notifications()
    >>> admins_notification['To']
    'mark@hbd.com,karl@canonical.com'

    >>> print member_notification['To']
    celso.providelo@canonical.com, colin.watson@ubuntulinux.com,
    foo.bar@canonical.com
    >>> print member_notification.get_payload() #doctest: -NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    Hello,
    <BLANKLINE>
    The membership status of Mirror Administrators (ubuntu-mirror-admins) in
    the team Ubuntu Team (ubuntu-team) was changed by Mark Shuttleworth
    (sabdfl) from Approved to Deactivated.
