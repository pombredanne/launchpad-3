The Build table
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The build table contains the information pertaining to a given build
of a sourcepackagerelease on a distroarchrelease.

The build record may have many BinaryPackageRelease records pointing
at it and it may reference a build log if the build was done on a
launchpad build daemon.

  >>> from zope.interface.verify import verifyObject
  >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import Build, BuildSet, DistributionSet
  >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import DistroRelease

  >>> ubuntu = DistributionSet()['ubuntu']
  >>> warty = DistroRelease.get(6)
  >>> hoary = DistroRelease.get(3)


First up, can we get the builds out of the sample data?

  >>> firefox_build = Build.get(2)
  >>> pmount_build = Build.get(7)

Let's check the complex properties of a build object.

  >>> firefox_build.distrorelease.name
  u'warty'

  >>> firefox_build.title
  u'i386 build of mozilla-firefox 0.9 in ubuntu warty (2004-09-27)'

  >>> firefox_build.build_icon
  '/++resource++build-success'

  >>> firefox_build.buildlog = 34
  >>> firefox_build.buildlog.url
  'http://localhost:58000/34/evolution-2.2-test.pot'

Initialize all the required arguments to create a binary package for a
given build record entry.

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IBinaryPackageNameSet
  >>> binarypackagename = getUtility(IBinaryPackageNameSet).ensure('demo').id
  >>> version = '0.0.1-demo'
  >>> summary = 'Summmmmmmmary'
  >>> description = 'Descripppppppption'
  >>> from canonical.lp import dbschema
  >>> binpackageformat = dbschema.BinaryPackageFormat.DEB
  >>> component = firefox_build.sourcepackagerelease.component.id
  >>> section = firefox_build.sourcepackagerelease.section.id
  >>> priority = dbschema.PackagePublishingPriority.STANDARD
  >>> shlibdeps = None
  >>> depends = None
  >>> recommends = None
  >>> suggests = None
  >>> conflicts = None
  >>> replaces = None
  >>> provides = None
  >>> essential = False
  >>> installedsize = 0
  >>> copyright = None
  >>> licence = None
  >>> architecturespecific = False 

Invoke createBinaryPackageRelease with all required arguments.

  >>> bin = Build.get(7).createBinaryPackageRelease(
  ...                                 binarypackagename, version,
  ...                                 summary, description,
  ...                                 binpackageformat, component,
  ...                                 section, priority, shlibdeps,
  ...                                 depends, recommends, suggests,
  ...                                 conflicts, replaces, provides,
  ...                                 essential, installedsize,
  ...                                 copyright, licence,
  ...                                 architecturespecific)

  >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IBinaryPackageRelease 
  >>> assert verifyObject(IBinaryPackageRelease, bin) is True

The BuildSet class gives us some useful ways to consider the
collection of builds.

  >>> bs = BuildSet()

We can find builds given a source package release and architecture tag.

  >>> bs.getBuildBySRAndArchtag(20,'i386').count()
  2

We can find recent and pending builds for a given distrorelease.

  >>> hoary.getBuildRecords().count()
  2

Or for a given distroarchrelease.

  >>> hoaryi386 = hoary.architectures[0]
  >>> hoaryi386.title
  u'The Hoary Hedgehog Release for i386 (x86)'

  >>> hoaryi386.getBuildRecords().count()
  2

And we can find builds for a given distribution by type.

  >>> from canonical.lp.dbschema import BuildStatus

  >>> ubuntu.getBuildRecords().count()
  4

  >>> L = list(ubuntu.getBuildRecords(status=BuildStatus.FULLYBUILT))
  >>> len(L)
  2
  >>> L[0].buildstate
  <Item FULLYBUILT (1) from <class 'canonical.lp.dbschema.BuildStatus'>>
  >>> L[1].buildstate
  <Item FULLYBUILT (1) from <class 'canonical.lp.dbschema.BuildStatus'>>


  >>> ubuntu.getBuildRecords(status=BuildStatus.NEEDSBUILD).count()
  1

  >>> firefox_build.buildstate = BuildStatus.NEEDSBUILD
  >>> firefox_build.syncUpdate()
  >>> L = list(ubuntu.getBuildRecords(status=BuildStatus.NEEDSBUILD))
  >>> len(L)
  2
  >>> L[0].buildstate
  <Item NEEDSBUILD (0) from <class 'canonical.lp.dbschema.BuildStatus'>>
