= RenamedView =

As Launchpad is reorganized, views are renamed. It is usually advisable
to leave a permanent redirect from the old name to the new name. This
allows search engines and bookmark to update transparently from the old
name to the new one.

For this case, we have a RenamedView that will take care of the
redirection.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.webapp.publisher import RenamedView
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.webapp.servers import LaunchpadTestRequest

Let's say we rename the '+old_tickets_page' view on IQuestionTarget to
'+questions'. A RenamedView redirecting to the new name would be created
like this:

    >>> request = LaunchpadTestRequest()
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IDistributionSet
    >>> ubuntu = getUtility(IDistributionSet).getByName('ubuntu')
    >>> view = RenamedView(ubuntu, request, '+questions')

(Note that the RenamedView class doesn't need to be aware of the
previous name. The old name will be hooked up with the RenamedView
via ZCML.)

When the view is called, it redirects to the same context but with
the new name. The redirection status is 301 (Moved permently) which
will make search engines discards the old URLs and some browser to
update bookmarks.

    >>> view()
    u''
    >>> request.response.getStatus()
    301
    >>> print request.response.getHeader('Location')
    http://launchpad.dev/ubuntu/+questions

== Handling GET parameters ==

If there was any query parameters on the request, they are appended
to the redirected URL.

    >>> request = LaunchpadTestRequest(
    ...     QUERY_STRING='field.status=Open')
    >>> view = RenamedView(ubuntu, request, '+questions')
    >>> view()
    u''
    >>> print request.response.getHeader('Location')
    http://launchpad.dev/ubuntu/+questions?field.status=Open

== Redirecting to another virtual host ==

The view also takes an optional 'rootsite' parameter, which will
change the virtual host used for the redirection.

    >>> request = LaunchpadTestRequest()
    >>> view = RenamedView(
    ...     ubuntu, request, '+questions', rootsite='answers')
    >>> view()
    u''
    >>> print request.response.getHeader('Location')
    http://answers.launchpad.dev/ubuntu/+questions

== Registering from ZCML ==

Finally, it is possible to register RenamedView from ZCML. The
browser:renamed-page is available for this purpose.

    >>> from zope.configuration import xmlconfig
    >>> zcmlcontext = xmlconfig.string("""
    ... <configure xmlns:browser="http://namespaces.zope.org/browser">
    ...   <include file="lib/canonical/launchpad/webapp/meta.zcml" />
    ...   <include file="lib/zope/app/meta.zcml" />
    ...   <browser:renamed-page
    ...       for="canonical.launchpad.interfaces.IQuestionTarget"
    ...       name="+old_tickets_page"
    ...       new_name="+questions"
    ...       rootsite="answers"
    ...       />
    ... </configure>
    ... """)

    >>> from zope.component import getMultiAdapter
    >>> request = LaunchpadTestRequest()
    >>> view = getMultiAdapter((ubuntu, request), name='+old_tickets_page')
    >>> view()
    u''
    >>> print request.response.getHeader('Location')
    http://answers.launchpad.dev/ubuntu/+questions
