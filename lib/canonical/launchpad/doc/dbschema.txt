Security proxies
----------------

SQLObjects that are security proxied should still behave normally, this includes
being comparable with non-security proxied objects.

First, some imports and set up::

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests.harness import LaunchpadFunctionalTestSetup
    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IPersonSet
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.database import Person

    >>> LaunchpadFunctionalTestSetup().setUp()

Get a proxied and unproxied person object for the same person, and demonstrate
working comparisons::

    >>> sabdfl = Person.get(1)
    >>> sabdfl_proxied = getUtility(IPersonSet).get(1)
    >>> sabdfl is sabdfl_proxied
    False
    >>> sabdfl == sabdfl
    True
    >>> sabdfl == sabdfl_proxied
    True
    >>> sabdfl_proxied == sabdfl
    True
    >>> sabdfl_proxied == sabdfl_proxied
    True

XXX: stevea: 20051018: Rewrite this test to use security proxies directly
XXX: bug 3315
DB schema objects should be comparable correctly when proxied...

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces import IDistroReleaseSet
    >>> from canonical.lp.dbschema import DistributionReleaseStatus
    >>> hoary = getUtility(IDistroReleaseSet).get(3)
    >>> print hoary.releasestatus.name
    DEVELOPMENT
    >>> hoary.releasestatus == DistributionReleaseStatus.DEVELOPMENT
    True
    >>> hoary.releasestatus is DistributionReleaseStatus.DEVELOPMENT
    False

Finally, tear down the test:

    >>> LaunchpadFunctionalTestSetup().tearDown()
