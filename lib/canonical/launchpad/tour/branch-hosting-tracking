                With Launchpad and Bazaar, anyone can create their own line of development, with full version control, to be published alongside your official branches. From experimental lines of development by entirely new contributors, to work on the the next major release, all code related to your project - whether hosted on Launchpad or elsewhere - is catalogued and can be downloaded with just a few key strokes.
            </p>
            <p class="intro-text">
               If your code's not in Bazaar, Launchpad will even run a continuous import of Subversion and CVS repositories directly into a Bazaar branch.

                            With Launchpad and Bazaar, contributors can create their own branch of your code, make their changes and then push it all back up to Launchpad to be listed right alongside your official branches. And because they never touch your trunk they don&rsquo;t need to ask for commit access.

                        <p>
Launchpad&rsquo;s <a href="code-review">code review</a> and Bazaar&rsquo;s superb support for merging make bringing the new code and its revision history back into your branch quick and easy.

                            Develop your fix in a Bazaar branch and link it to the bug report. Anyone interested in the bug can track your progress and get access to your fix with a single command.
</p><p>
In effect, your branch becomes a living patch: the very latest version of your code is always available as direct link from the bug report.

                        <p>
Thanks to Bazaar&rsquo;s workflow flexibility, all team members can commit to a centrally hosted branch, while anyone can still create their own separate line of development with full version control.
