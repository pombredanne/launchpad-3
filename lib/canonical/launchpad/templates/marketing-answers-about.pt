        <h3>About the Answer Tracker</h3>

        <p>A helpful community surrounds every successful open source project.
           Launchpad's Answer Tracker gives you a structured way to help your
           users, whilst encouraging community participation and building your
           knowledge-base.
        </p>

        <p>Unlike forums and mailing lists, the Answer Tracker has features to
           track the progress of a support request and rewards participants
           with karma. All previous answers are searchable and Launchpad will
           even suggest relevant answers, when a user asks a new question.
           Members of your community can volunteer to receive automatic
           notifications when new questions are asked in their preferred
           languages.
         </p>

         <p>You get a quick overview of top issues, can track the progress of
           support requests and can easily create bug reports from support
           requests.
