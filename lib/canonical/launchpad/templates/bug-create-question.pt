            This bug may be valid in other locations. Only one location must

          <p>
            Some bug reports are really questions, or the reporter
            is confused, and an explanation is needed. In such cases,
            the bug can made into a question. When a bug is made into a
            question, the bug's status is set to Invalid. The new question
            will be linked to the bug.

        A bug must meet a few conditions to be convertible to a question.
        its status must be either New, Incomplete, Confirmed, or Wont Fix
        The bug's project must use Launchpad to track bugs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bugs that are also in external bug trackers cannot be converted
        to questions. This is also true for bugs that are being developed.
        If a bug is valid (not Invalid) in many locations, it cannot be
        made into a question--a bug report cannot be a bug in one project,
        but a question in another.
      </p>
      <p>
        Only one question can be created from a bug. Once a bug is made
        into a question, the bug is Invalid.
