<div metal:fill-slot="main">

  <p>
    All graphics should be provided in scalable versions such as SVG,
    as well as PNG bitmaps of the specified size.
    Each graphic should have a PNG bitmap in the
    &ldquo;icon&rdquo; size, unless otherwise listed.
  </p>

      <dfn>badge</dfn>
    </dt>
    <dd>
      badges are designed to be used inline in text. At 12px &times; 12px
      they are almost small enough to fit in a line of text without pushing
      it down - we might consider making them 11px &times; 11px because then
      they will be able to be used in any text without affecting the flow
      at all.  These images should have the <code>-badge</code> suffix.
      They should only be used in text to indicate a pillar item - a team,
      person, upstream, distro etc.
      Examples are <img src="/@@/distribution-badge" />,
      <img src="/@@/person-badge" /> and <img src="/@@/product-badge" />.
      Note that there are <strong>no customised versions of these
      per-pillar</strong>. Each pillar can have a custom icon, see below.

    <dt>
      <img alt="" src="/@@/nyet-icon" style="float: right;" />
      <dfn>icon</dfn>
    </dt>
    <dd>
      A standard icon. The size is 14px &times; 14px. This is too large to
      use in paragraph text without affecting the flow of the text layout
      (creating a gap between the line containing the image and the line
      above it).  An icon is small enough to be used in a table listing
      without affecting the row height. In a textual listing (such as a bug
      listing) where there are two or more lines of text such as the
      bug-listing-detailed.pt which is used for latest bug portlets, these
      images should be allowed to flow across both top and bottom lines of
      the listing.  These icons should not have a suffix. You should get
      this for a pillar object using <code>/image:icon</code>. Pillar objects
      should optionally have custom icons, and they should be used in
      detailed listings (not simple listings - for those please use badges).
      Team icons should be of the icon size, not badge size.
    </dd>
    <dt>
      <img alt="" src="/@@/nyet-large" style="float: right;" />
      <dfn>large</dfn>
    </dt>
    <dd>
      Large icons are used for metadata about objects, for example bug
      privacy. They are 32px &times; 32px in size. They should only be used
      on the page of the object being described itself, not in listings or
      in links.  So, for example, when listing a private bug in a table of
      bugs, use the icon. On the private bug page itself, use the large
      icon. These icons should have the <code>-large</code> suffix.
      They should <strong>all have a standard-icon sized
      equivalent</strong>, for use in listings.
    </dd>
    <dt>
      <img alt="" src="/@@/nyet-logo" style="float: right;" />
      <dfn>logo</dfn>
    </dt>
    <dd>
      This image is used in the heading of any Pillar object - people,
      projects, products and distributions.  There should be default
      versions of these images which correspond to the type of Pillar - so a
      default for Product, a default for Project, Distribution, etc.
      These will be required to be 64px &times; 64px in size.
      The Logo is also used for ANY object which is a child of the pillar.
      So, for example, the Ubuntu Logo will be used for a Ubuntu
      Specification.
    </dd>
    <dt>
      <img alt="" src="/@@/nyet-mugshot" style="float: right;" />
      <dfn>mugshot</dfn>
    </dt>
    <dd>
      Represents people and projects on their Overview pages.
      Please note that the mugshot is ONLY displayed on that one page per
      pillar: http://launchpad.net/pillar/. It is not used anywhere else in
      the site.  These images are allowed to be up to 192px &times; 192px in
      size, including whitespace. If a smaller image is uploaded, it will
      converted and set in the middle of a white 192px &times; 192px square.
