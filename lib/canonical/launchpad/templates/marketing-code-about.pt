        <h3>About Launchpad Code Hosting</h3>

        <p>With Bazaar version control, anyone can create and publish their
           own branches of your code. New contributors can have version
           control of their own branch without needing special commit
           permissions.
        </p>

        <p>Launchpad's browsable branch registry helps your community track
           all the branches of your project. Anyone can publish their branch
           to Launchpad, or ask Launchpad to mirror branches that are hosted
           elsewhere on the internet. Launchpad reports the progress of all
           branches, while giving special placement to major lines of
           development.
         </p>

        <p>You can also track the links between branches and other tools in
           Launchpad. When a developer creates a branch to fix a particular
           bug or implement a blueprint, they can connect the two. All the
           discussion from the bug report or blueprint is now immediately
           available to people browsing the code.
         </p>

        <p>For projects that use Subversion or CVS for revision control,
          Launchpad can maintain a continuous import of the development trunk
          into Bazaar. This allows new contributors to work on the code,
          before they get commit access.
        </p>
