    Launchpad is integrated with the <a href="http://bazaar-vcs.org/">Bazaar</a>
    version control system.
    (<a href="http://bazaar-vcs.org/WhyUseBzr">Why use Bazaar?</a>)
  </p>

  <h2>Branch registry</h2>

  <p>
    To register a branch so other people can find it,
    go to the page of the product the branch belongs to,
    and click &ldquo;Register Bazaar Branch&rdquo;.
    Launchpad will automatically maintain a mirror of the branch.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can register a branch on behalf someone else from that person&rsquo;s
    page,
    or by setting the author field when registering a branch on a product.
    (The URL of the branch mirror is based on the nickname of
    the registrant, not the author.)
  </p>

  <h2>VCS imports</h2>

  <p>
    If the project you are working on uses CVS or Subversion, Launchpad can
    produce a Bazaar branch that is synchronised daily with the HEAD or trunk
    of the project, so you can use Bazaar to manage you own changes even if the
    project leaders do not.
  </p>

  <p>
    To set up a VCS import, edit the source details of the trunk release series
    of the product.
  </p>

  <h2>Hosted branches</h2>

  <p>
    Launchpad provides hosting for Bazaar branches.
  </p>

  <p>
    First, you need to register a SSH key from your person's page. Click on
    your name at the top of any Launchpad page when logged in to go to your
    person's page.
  </p>

  <p>
    To create a hosted branch, use the <code>bzr push</code> command. The
    destination URL must be of the form:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>
    sftp://<i>user</i>@bazaar.launchpad.net/~<i>registrant</i>/<i>product</i>/<i>branch</i>
  </p>
  </blockquote>

  <ul>
    <li><i>user</i> is your short name in Launchpad.</li>

    <li><i>registrant</i> is your short name in Launchpad, for a personal
      branch. It can be the name of a team for a shared branch.</li>

    <li><i>product</i> is the short name of the Launchpad product the branch
      belongs to.</li>

    <li><i>branch</i> is the short name of the branch. If you are uploading
      your main development branch, <code>devel</code> is a good generic name.
      It needs only be unique for a given <code>registrant</code> and
      <code>product</code>.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>For example, if your Launchpad user name were <code>john</code>, and you
    wanted to upload a personal branch of the <code>froboize</code> product,
    you could use the following command:</p>

  <blockquote>
    bzr push sftp://john@bazaar.launchpad.net/~john/froboize/devel
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    To create a shared branch to which multiple people can commit and push, as
    with CVS or Subversion, use the name of a team you belong to as the
    <i>registrant</i>. All the members of that team will be able to edit the
    branch details and to push to that branch.
  </p>

  <h2>Integration with other services</h2>

  <p>
    You can associate a branch to a <a href="/bugs">Malone<a> bug report, for
    example if the branch contains a fix for the bug, instead of attaching a
    patch the old-fashioned way.
