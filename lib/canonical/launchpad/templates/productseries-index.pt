      A "release series" is major release that would typically have a number
      of "point releases" associated with it. For example, Mozilla Firefox
      series "1.5" has releases such as "1.5a1", "1.5b1", "1.5.0" and
      "1.5.2". In revision control terms, the best practice is to
      create a Bazaar branch for this specific series of releases.
