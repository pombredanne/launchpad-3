  <p>
    The packages incorporation work-flow within a distroseries is
    represented as a pipeline.
  </p>
  <p>
    The pipeline can process three types of packages: Sources, which
    contain one uploaded source package each submitted by the
    developers; Builds, which can contain, at least, one binary packages
    and optionally, one or more custom packages, it's resulted of the
    build of a published source; and Customs, a single custom package.
  </p>
  <p>
    Custom uploads are special files, usually a tarball, that are not
    targeted to be build normally (i.e, they are not sources, neither
    binaries), instead they have specific contents to be directly
    processed by one of the available custom processors in
    Launchpad. Currently, the following custom processors are offered:
    Installer, Dist-Upgrader, DDTP and Translations.
  </p>
  <p>
    All incoming packages tend to go for the stable states, DONE or
    REJECTED, the end of the pipeline, which means that the package
    was completely incorporated or excluded, respectively, in the
    distroseries in question.
  </p>
  <p>
    All incoming packages, essentially, start in NEW stage. Already
    known packages, which previous versions are already incorporated,
    are automatically moved to ACCEPTED stage, the remaining ones
    need manual approval of the archive administrators for this
    distroseries to continue.
  </p>
  <p>
    Packages with some policy restrictions, like post-release updates
    and security updates, also wait manual approval as UNAPPROVED.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once a package is in ACCEPTED stage, it waits the distroseries
    periodic publication cycle to happen, then sources will get
    published and will start building and builds and customs will be
    published in the archive appropriately, ending up in DONE.
