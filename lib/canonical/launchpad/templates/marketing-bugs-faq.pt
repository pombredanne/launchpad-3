    <h5 id="q1">Can I import data from my existing bug tracker?</h5>
    <p>Yes. We can already import data from ?BugZilla and Sourceforge and will
       work with open source projects to help you import your bug data from
       other bug trackers, free of charge.
    </p>

    <h5 id="q2">Can I define custom bug states?</h5>
    <p>Launchpad mixes fixed bug states with ad-hoc bug tagging. Consistent
       bug states make it easy for anyone to understand what at what stage a
       particular bug is and make it easy for projects to collaborate. Bug
       tagging allows you to create groups of bugs which share a common
       property.

    <h5 id="q3">Why is it useful to link my bugs to those in external
                trackers?</h5>
    <p>Bugs that appear in your software may not always be in your code.
       Launchpad understands the connections between open source projects,
       with software almost always relying on at least one other open source
       project. Links to bugs in the trackers of other projects allow you to
       combine their experience and solutions with your own.

    <h5 id="q4">Does Launchpad's Bug Tracker offer a scriptable
                interface?</h5>
    <p>Yes. As well as an easy to use web interface, Launchpad's Bug Tracker
       has an email interface, allowing to report, comment on and edit bugs.
       We're also currently developing an XML-RPC API.
    </p>
    <p class="backtotop"><a href="#top" title="Back to top">Back to top</a></p>

    <h5 id="q5">Can I mark bugs as private?</h5>
    <p>Yes. Launchpad makes it easy to mark bugs as private, allowing only
       authorised subscribers to see the bug's details.
    </p>
    <p class="backtotop"><a href="#top" title="Back to top">Back to top</a></p>

    <h5 id="q6">How does Launchpad help me deal effectively with
                security bugs?</h5>
    <p>Launchpad is designed to handle security issues efficiently and with
       the minimum risk possible. As well offering private bugs, Launchpad
       will monitor relevant CVE security vulnerability registries and allow
       you to designate an individual or team as security contact or your
       project. As soon as a security issue is raised, Launchpad emails your
       security contact, enabling you to take immediate action.
