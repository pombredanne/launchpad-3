    <h1>About the Launchpad Registry</h1>

    <p>Based on Edd Dumbill's DOAP framework for open source project
    descriptions, this system allows us to keep track of all the open source
    projects that ultimately are packaged in Ubuntu and its
    derivatives, or translated in, or have bugs tracked by Launchpad.</p>

    <p>Each open source project includes a description of the project, and
    links to translations, bugs, bazaar branches of the code itself and
    packages in Ubuntu.</p>
