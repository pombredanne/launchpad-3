Hello %(user_name)s,

You recently registered the project '%(product_name)s' in Launchpad
with this licensing:

%(license_titles)s.

Launchpad is a collaboration site that is free to use for projects
with an approved open source license.  When you registered your
project the list of licenses presented are the ones we automatically
recognize.

Other licenses must follow the guidelines we list on the following
page in order to be approved:
https://help.launchpad.net/Legal/ProjectLicensing

Further information is on our FAQ "Can closed-source or proprietary
projects use Launchpad?" which can be found at:
https://answers.launchpad.net/launchpad/+faq/208

If your project's licensing does not meet the guidelines we will
consider it "Proprietary" and mark it as such in Launchpad.

Proprietary projects can use Launchpad by purchasing a commercial-use
subscription which costs US$250/year/project.  Please follow the
instructions presented on your project overview page to purchase a
subscription voucher.  Feel free to contact me if you have any
questions.

Sometimes new projects are licensed as 'Other/Open Source' because the
licensing decisions have not yet been made.  If that is your situation
we urge you to update the licensing in Launchpad as soon as you make
that choice.

If the license for your project needs to be corrected you can do so by
following the 'Change Details' link on your project's overview page.

Thanks,

The Launchpad team.
