Hello %(importer)s,

On %(dateimport)s (%(elapsedtime)s), you uploaded a file with
%(import_title)s in Rosetta.

We didn't import it because we found errors in the file format.

You can check this file with the 'msgfmt' command. Please fix any
error raised by that tool and upload the file again. If you check
the file and you don't find any error in it, please, contact us to
help you with this problem.

For your convenience, you can get the file you uploaded at:

Thanks for using Rosetta.
