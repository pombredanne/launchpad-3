Doctests moved from ZopelessTransactionManager.

>>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests.harness import LaunchpadTestSetup
>>> dbname = LaunchpadTestSetup().dbname
>>> dbname
'launchpad_ftest'
>>> from canonical.database.sqlbase import ZopelessTransactionManager
>>> ztm = ZopelessTransactionManager('postgres:///' + dbname)

The _connection attribute of SQLBase should now be a descriptor that returns
sqlobject.dbconnection.Transaction instances.

>>> from sqlobject.dbconnection import Transaction
>>> from canonical.database.sqlbase import SQLBase
>>> t1 = SQLBase._connection
>>> isinstance(t1, Transaction)
True

And it should give the same connection to the same thread over multiple
accesses.

>>> t2 = SQLBase._connection
>>> t1 is t2
True

And different in different threads:

>>> from threading import Thread, Lock, Event
>>> l = []
>>> e = Event()
>>> def target():
...     l.append(SQLBase._connection)
>>> t = Thread(target=target)
>>> t.start()
>>> t.join(20)

>>> l[0] is not t1
True

 
XXX: ddaa 2005-05-10: This bit is overly dependent on the db...
Show that concurrent transactions in different threads work correctly

>>> from sqlobject import StringCol
>>> from canonical.launchpad.database import Person
>>> mark = Person.selectOneBy(displayname='Mark Shuttleworth')
>>> mark.id == 1
True
>>> mark.givenname = 'Markk'
>>> mark.givenname = 'Mark'
>>> ztm.commit()
>>> ztm.commit()
 
>>> event = Event()
>>> event2 = Event()
>>> def foo(Person=Person, ztm=ztm, event=event, event2=event2):
...     andrew = Person.selectOneBy(displayname='Andrew Bennetts')
...     
...     andrew.givenname = 'Andreww'
...     andrew.givenname = 'Andrew'
...     event.set()
...     event2.wait()
...     ztm.commit()
...
>>> t = Thread(target=foo)
>>> t.start()
>>> event.wait()
>>> mark = Person.selectOneBy(displayname='Mark Shuttleworth')
>>> mark.id == 1
True
>>> mark.givenname = 'Markk'
>>> mark.givenname = 'Mark'
>>> ztm.commit()
>>> event2.set()
>>> t.join(20)

A failed commit, e.g. due to a transaction conflict or integrity error, will
raise an exception, but still make it possible to begin a new transaction.

>>> from psycopg import DatabaseError
>>> import sys
>>> ztm.begin()
>>> andrew = Person.byName('spiv')
>>> andrew.name = 'sabdfl'
>>> try: ztm.commit()
... except DatabaseError: print sys.exc_value
ERROR:  duplicate key violates unique constraint "person_name_key"
<BLANKLINE>
UPDATE Person SET name = 'sabdfl' WHERE id = 7
>>> ztm.begin()
>>> ztm.abort()

By default, our connection is reset at the end of every transaction.  That
means that any session state, such as temporary tables, is lost when we
commit.

Say we create a temporary table called "anothertesttable," which did not exist
before.

>>> from canonical.database.sqlbase import cursor
>>> test_table = "anothertesttable"
>>> cursor().execute("SELECT count(*) FROM %s" % test_table)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ProgrammingError: ERROR: relation "..." does not exist
...

>>> ztm.abort()
>>> ztm.begin()
>>> cur = cursor()
>>> cur.execute("CREATE TEMP TABLE %s (col integer)" % test_table)
>>> cur.execute("SELECT count(*) FROM %s" % test_table)
>>> print cur.fetchone()
(0L,)

If we commit, the temporary table will be destroyed as our connection is
reset.  By default a temporary table will survive a commit, but not the end
of a connection.

>>> ztm.commit()
>>> ztm.begin()
>>> cur = cursor()
>>> cur.execute("SELECT count(*) FROM %s" % test_table)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ProgrammingError: ERROR: relation "..." does not exist
...

The exact same thing happens when a transaction is aborted: temporary tables
are destroyed.

>>> ztm.abort()
>>> ztm.begin()
>>> cur = cursor()
>>> cur.execute("CREATE TEMP TABLE %s (col integer)" % test_table)
>>> cur.execute("SELECT count(*) FROM %s" % test_table)
>>> print cur.fetchone()
(0L,)

>>> ztm.abort()
>>> ztm.begin()
>>> cur = cursor()
>>> cur.execute("SELECT count(*) FROM %s" % test_table)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ProgrammingError: ERROR: relation "..." does not exist
...

The automatic resetting of connections is controlled by a Boolean field called
reset_after_transaction.

>>> ztm.reset_after_transaction
True

When we disable the automatic resetting of connections, the connection remains
active across transactions.  We don't normally do this because resetting the
transaction doesn't cost much and guards us against leaks and such.  It may be
necessary, however, in cases where temporary tables must live across
transactions such as while copying large amounts of data.

>>> ztm.reset_after_transaction = False
>>> ztm.abort()
>>> ztm.begin()
>>> cur = cursor()
>>> cur.execute("CREATE TEMP TABLE %s (col integer)" % test_table)
>>> cur.execute("SELECT count(*) FROM %s" % test_table)
>>> print cur.fetchone()
(0L,)
>>> ztm.commit()
>>> ztm.begin()
>>> cur.execute("SELECT count(*) FROM %s" % test_table)
>>> print cur.fetchone()
(0L,)

>>> ztm.begin()
>>> ztm.abort()
>>> cur.execute("SELECT count(*) FROM %s" % test_table)
>>> print cur.fetchone()
(0L,)

Cleanup -- make sure this doctest leaves things in the same state it found
them.

>>> ztm.reset_after_transaction = False
>>> ztm.uninstall()
>>> from canonical.testing import DatabaseLayer
>>> DatabaseLayer.force_dirty_database()
