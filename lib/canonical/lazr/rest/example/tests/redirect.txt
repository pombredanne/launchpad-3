The RedirectResource is a simple resource implementation that
redirects the client to another URL.

The example web service implements the CookbookSetTraverse class to
serve a RedirectResource at /cookbooks/featured. This particular
RedirectResource redirects you to the currently featured cookbook.

  >>> from canonical.lazr.testing.webservice import CookbookWebServiceCaller
  >>> webservice = CookbookWebServiceCaller()

  >>> print webservice.get("/cookbooks/featured")
  HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
  ...
  Location: http://.../cookbooks/Mastering%20the%20Art%20of%20French%20Cooking
  <BLANKLINE>

The redirect has an extra twist when the resource was requested from a
web browser as opposed to a web service client. When a web browser
follows a redirect, it does not re-send the Accept header from the
original request. This can lead to lazr.restful serving the wrong
representation (usually HTML instead of JSON). To avoid this problem,
lazr.restful sends the original Accept header in the redirect URL
itself, so it can look it up when the browser follows the redirect.

  >>> from canonical.lazr.testing.webservice import (
  ...     CookbookWebServiceAjaxCaller)
  >>> ajax = CookbookWebServiceAjaxCaller()
  >>> print ajax.get("/cookbooks/featured")
  HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
  ...
  Location: http://.../cookbooks/Mastering%20the%20Art%20of%20French%20Cooking?ws.accept=application/json
  <BLANKLINE>
