Adding a comment or review to a merge proposal will take the user back
to the main merge proposal page.

    >>> anon_browser.open(merge_proposal_url)
    >>> def print_comments(klass, browser=None, index=0):
    ...     if browser is None:
    ...         browser = anon_browser
    ...     tags = find_tags_by_class(browser.contents, klass)
    ...     for count, tag in enumerate(tags):
    ...         if count == index:
    ...             print extract_text(tag)

    >>> print_comments('boardCommentDetails')
    Eric the Viking wrote ...
    >>> print_comments('boardCommentBody')
    This is a very long comment about what things should be done to the
    source branch to land it. When this comment is replied to, it should
    wrap the line properly.
    >>> print_comments('commentSuffix')
    Reply

The person's name links back to the main site for that person.

    >>> print anon_browser.getLink('Eric the Viking').url
    http://launchpad.dev/~eric

Reply link is displayed even if the user isn't logged in.

    >>> anon_browser.getLink('Reply').click()
    Traceback (most recent call last):

We can reply to a comment.

    >>> eric_browser.open(merge_proposal_url)
    >>> eric_browser.getLink('Reply').click()
    >>> print eric_browser.getControl(name='field.comment').value.replace(
    ...     '\r\n', '\n') # doctest: -NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    > This is a very long comment about what things should be done to the source

    >>> eric_browser.getControl(name='field.comment').value = ('I like this.\n'
    ... 'I wish I had time to review it properly\n\n'
    ... 'This is a longer\nmessage with several\nlines')
    >>> eric_browser.getControl(name='field.actions.add').click()

After this, we are taken to the main page for the merge proposal

    >>> print_comments('boardCommentBody', eric_browser, index=1)
    I like this.
    I wish I had time to review it properly
    This is a longer message with several lines
