Branch Visibility
=================

Most branches on Launchpad are considered public branches, and are
visible to everybody, even people not logged in.

Some branches are also considered "private".  These are branches that
are only visible to the owner of the branch, and the subscribers.

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from lp.code.enums import BranchType
    >>> from lp.code.interfaces.branch import IBranchSet
    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.person import IPersonSet
    >>> person_set = getUtility(IPersonSet)
    >>> no_priv_person = person_set.getByName('no-priv')

    >>> from lp.code.interfaces.branchnamespace import (
    ...     get_branch_namespace)
    >>> namespace = get_branch_namespace(no_priv_person)
    >>> proxied_branch = namespace.createBranch(
    ...     branch_type=BranchType.HOSTED, name='test-branch',
    ...     registrant=no_priv_person, title='Test branch')

Since many of the examples here are testing the ability of various users
to access branches, we don't want all the access to the branch to go
through the security proxy, as when the AccessBranch authorization class
is used, it does not have a proxied object, but the direct object.  This
is needed as in order to check to see if the user is authorized to see
the branch we have to look at some of the member variables for the
branch, and accessing these member variables triggers an authorization
check on the proxied object.  So we'll remove it.

    >>> from zope.security.proxy import removeSecurityProxy
    >>> branch = removeSecurityProxy(proxied_branch)

    >>> print branch.unique_name
    ~no-priv/+junk/test-branch

    >>> branch.private
    False

Calling check_permission is used to show that the AccessBranch is in
fact configured correctly.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.webapp.authorization import check_permission
    >>> login(ANONYMOUS)
    >>> check_permission('launchpad.View', proxied_branch)
    True

    >>> login('test@canonical.com')
    >>> check_permission('launchpad.View', proxied_branch)
    True


Accessing branches
------------------

Accessing any attributes of the Branch content class through the IBranch
interface is configured to require the launchpad.View permission. The
AccessBranch authorization class is used to authorize users for the
combination of the launchpad.View permission and the IBranch interface.

    >>> from zope.component import getAdapter
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.webapp.interfaces import IAuthorization
    >>> getAdapter(branch, IAuthorization, name='launchpad.View')
    <canonical.launchpad.security.AccessBranch ...>

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.security import AccessBranch
    >>> access = AccessBranch(branch)
    >>> access.checkUnauthenticated()
    True

    >>> access.checkAccountAuthenticated(no_priv_person.account)
    True

Branches that are private are accessible by the owner and subscribers.


Visibility due to ownership
---------------------------

The owners of the branch always have visibility of their own branches.

    >>> branch.private = True
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.webapp.authorization import clear_cache
    >>> clear_cache() # clear authorization cache for check_permission
    >>> access.checkUnauthenticated()
    False

    >>> branch.owner == no_priv_person
    True

    >>> access.checkAccountAuthenticated(no_priv_person.account)
    True

Check the configuration of the AccessBranch authorization.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.webapp.interfaces import ILaunchBag
    >>> print getUtility(ILaunchBag).user.displayname
    Sample Person

    >>> getUtility(ILaunchBag).user == no_priv_person
    False

    >>> check_permission('launchpad.View', proxied_branch)
    False


Visibility due to being a Launchpad administrator
-------------------------------------------------

Mark is a Launchpad administrator, and Launchpad administrators are
special.  Launchpad administrators often have a need to see private
Launchpad things in order to fix up fubars by users.

    >>> mark = person_set.getByName('mark')
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces.launchpad import (
    ...     ILaunchpadCelebrities)
    >>> lp_admins = getUtility(ILaunchpadCelebrities).admin
    >>> mark.inTeam(lp_admins)
    True

    >>> access.checkAccountAuthenticated(mark.account)
    True


Visibility due to subscription
------------------------------

Branches that are not public are viewable by members of the
visibility_team and to subscribers.

The Jeff Waugh is a member of the Ubuntu team, but not a Luanchpad
admin.

    >>> jdub = person_set.getByName('jdub')
    >>> ubuntu_team = person_set.getByName('ubuntu-team')
    >>> jdub.inTeam(ubuntu_team)
    True

    >>> jdub.inTeam(lp_admins)
    False

    >>> access.checkAccountAuthenticated(jdub.account)
    False

Subscribing the Ubuntu team to the branch will allow Jeff to have access
to the branch.

    >>> from lp.code.enums import (
    ...     BranchSubscriptionNotificationLevel, BranchSubscriptionDiffSize,
    ...     CodeReviewNotificationLevel)

    >>> branch.subscribe(ubuntu_team,
    ...     BranchSubscriptionNotificationLevel.NOEMAIL,
    ...     BranchSubscriptionDiffSize.NODIFF,
    ...     CodeReviewNotificationLevel.NOEMAIL, ubuntu_team.teamowner)
    <BranchSubscription ...>

    >>> access.checkAccountAuthenticated(jdub.account)
    True


Not visible to everyone else
----------------------------

David is not a Launchpad admin, nor is currently subscribed to our new
branch.

    >>> ddaa = person_set.getByName('ddaa')
    >>> ddaa.inTeam(lp_admins)
    False

    >>> access.checkAccountAuthenticated(ddaa.account)
    False


BranchSet restricted queries
----------------------------

All of the BranchSet queries that are used to populate user viewable
branch listings have an optional parameter called `visible_by_user`.
This parameter is used to restrict the result set to those branches that
would be visible by that user.  If the parameter is None, then only the
public branches are returned.

Since we are printing out general private branch details, we log in a
member of the Launchpad admin team so there are no permission errors.

    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')

The syncUpdate call is necessary to make sure the database has the
private flag set correctly for the branch.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests import syncUpdate
    >>> syncUpdate(branch)

    >>> branch_set = getUtility(IBranchSet)

Anonymous users see just the public branches.

    >>> for branch in branch_set.getRecentlyRegisteredBranches(3):
    ...     print branch.unique_name, branch.private
    ~mark/+junk/testdoc False
    ~name12/gnome-terminal/scanned False
    ~name12/gnome-terminal/mirrored False

David is not in eligible to see any of the private branches.

    >>> for branch in branch_set.getRecentlyRegisteredBranches(
    ...     3, visible_by_user=ddaa):
    ...     print branch.unique_name, branch.private
    ~mark/+junk/testdoc False
    ~name12/gnome-terminal/scanned False
    ~name12/gnome-terminal/mirrored False

No Privileges Person sees his new private junk branch and other public
branches.

    >>> for branch in branch_set.getRecentlyRegisteredBranches(
    ...     3, visible_by_user=no_priv_person):
    ...     print branch.unique_name, branch.private
    ~no-priv/+junk/test-branch True
    ~mark/+junk/testdoc False
    ~name12/gnome-terminal/scanned False

Mark as a Launchpad admin can see all the private branches.

    >>> for branch in branch_set.getRecentlyRegisteredBranches(
    ...     3, visible_by_user=mark):
    ...     print branch.unique_name, branch.private
    ~no-priv/+junk/test-branch True
    ~name12/landscape/feature-x True
    ~landscape-developers/landscape/trunk True

Sample Person as the author of the Landscape branches sees those, but
not the private branch owned by No Privileges Person.

    >>> sample_person = person_set.getByEmail('test@canonical.com')
    >>> for branch in branch_set.getRecentlyRegisteredBranches(
    ...     3, visible_by_user=sample_person):
    ...     print branch.unique_name, branch.private
    ~name12/landscape/feature-x True
    ~landscape-developers/landscape/trunk True
    ~mark/+junk/testdoc False
