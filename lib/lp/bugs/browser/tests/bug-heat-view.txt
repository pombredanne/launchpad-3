= Bug heat view =

Bug heat is represented as four flame icons. The quantity of flames that are
coloured is dependent on the value of the heat field. The function
bugtask_heat_html is used to render the flames.

    >>> MAX_HEAT = 5000.0
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests import login, logout
    >>> from zope.security.proxy import removeSecurityProxy
    >>> from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup
    >>> from lp.bugs.browser.bugtask import bugtask_heat_html
    >>> def print_flames(bugtask, target=None):
    ...     html = bugtask_heat_html(bugtask, target=target)
    ...     soup = BeautifulSoup(html)
    ...     for img in soup.span.a.contents:
    ...         print img['src']
    ...         print img['alt']
    ...         print img['title']
    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')
    >>> bug = factory.makeBug()

The maximum heat is defined as a constant in browser/bug.py. A bug with
a heat of half the maximum will result in a display of two coloured flames
and two black-and-white flames.

    >>> removeSecurityProxy(bug.default_bugtask.target).max_bug_heat = MAX_HEAT
    >>> removeSecurityProxy(bug).heat = MAX_HEAT / 2
    >>> print_flames(bug.default_bugtask)
    /@@/bug-heat-2.png
    2 out of 4 heat flames
    Heat: 2500

A bug with a maximum heat will display all four flames coloured.

    >>> removeSecurityProxy(bug).heat = MAX_HEAT
    >>> print_flames(bug.default_bugtask)
    /@@/bug-heat-4.png
    4 out of 4 heat flames
    Heat: 5000

A heat of less than a quarter of the maximum will display no coloured flames.

    >>> removeSecurityProxy(bug).heat = 0.1 * MAX_HEAT
    >>> print_flames(bug.default_bugtask)
    /@@/bug-heat-0.png
    0 out of 4 heat flames
    Heat: 500


== Specifying the target ==

Some bugs can be viewed in a context different from their task's target. For
example, bugs with tasks on packages can be viewed in the context of the entire
distribution. In such cases, we want to explicitly specify the target, rather
than use the bugtask's. We can do that by passing the target as a keyword
parameter.

    >>> bug = factory.makeBug()
    >>> distro = factory.makeDistribution()
    >>> dsp = factory.makeDistributionSourcePackage(distribution=distro)
    >>> dsp_task = bug.addTask(bug.owner, dsp)
    >>> removeSecurityProxy(distro).max_bug_heat = MAX_HEAT
    >>> removeSecurityProxy(dsp).max_bug_heat = MAX_HEAT / 2
    >>> removeSecurityProxy(bug).heat = MAX_HEAT / 4
    >>> print_flames(dsp_task)
    /@@/bug-heat-2.png
    2 out of 4 heat flames
    Heat: 1250
    >>> print_flames(dsp_task, target=distro)
    /@@/bug-heat-0.png
    0 out of 4 heat flames
    Heat: 1250

    >>> logout()


== Scaling Bug Heat ==

To ensure a reasonable proportion of cold and hot bugs, the number used to
calculate the number of flames to display is not a straight-forward ratio.
Instead, we transform it by forcing low heat bugs to produce no flames and
scaling the hottest bugs logarithmically.

    >>> from lp.bugs.browser.bugtask import calculate_heat_display
    >>> from math import floor

Heat values less than a third of the maximum heat don't produce any flames.

    >>> print int(floor((300.0 / 1000.0) * 4))
    1
    >>> print calculate_heat_display(300.0, 1000.0)
    0

Heat values higher than a third of the max but lower than two thirds are treated
as a straightforward ratio.

    >>> print int(floor((500.0 / 1000.0) * 4))
    2
    >>> print calculate_heat_display(500.0, 1000.0)
    2

Heat values higher than two thirds of the maximum heat are scaled upwards.

    >>> print int(floor((700.0 / 1000.0) * 4))
    2
    >>> print calculate_heat_display(800.0, 1000.0)
    3

A max heat value of 1 works too, because we don't divide by
log(max_heat) in this case.

    >>> print calculate_heat_display(1, 1)
    4

Even if the max heat value is smaller than the heat value itself,
calculate_heat_display() does not return a value greater than 4.

    >>> print calculate_heat_display(2000, 1000)
    4
