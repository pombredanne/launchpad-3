Calculating bug heat
====================

Launchpad bugs each have a 'heat' rating. This is an indicator of how
problematic a given bug is to the community and can be used to determine
which bugs should be tackled first.

A new bug will have a heat of zero.

    >>> bug_owner = factory.makePerson()
    >>> bug = factory.makeBug(owner=bug_owner)
    >>> bug.heat
    0

The bug's heat can be set by calling its setHeat() method.

    >>> bug.setHeat(42)
    >>> bug.heat
    42


The BugHeatUpdater class
---------------------------

In order to calculate bug heat we need to use the BugHeatUpdater
class, which is designed precisely for that task. It's part of the garbo
module and runs as part of the garbo-daily cronjob.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.scripts.garbo import BugHeatUpdater
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.scripts import FakeLogger

    >>> update_bug_heat = BugHeatUpdater(FakeLogger())

BugHeatUpdater implements ITunableLoop and as such is callable. Calling
it as a method will update the heat for all the bugs currently held in
Launchpad.

Before update_bug_heat is called, bug 1 will have no heat.

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from lp.bugs.interfaces.bug import IBugSet
    >>> bug_1 = getUtility(IBugSet).get(1)

    >>> bug_1.heat
    0

    >>> update_bug_heat(chunk_size=1)
    DEBUG Updating 1 Bugs (starting id: ...)
    ...

Bug 1's heat will now be greater than 0.

    >>> bug_1.heat > 0
    True
