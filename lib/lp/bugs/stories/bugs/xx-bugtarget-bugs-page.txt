= The bugs index page for bug targets =

The bugs index page for bug targets is one of the first Launchpad
page to embed all its action links in the main content area, rather
than in an 'Actions' portlet.

    >>> browser.open('http://bugs.launchpad.dev/ubuntu/+bugs-index')
    >>> print find_portlet(browser.contents, 'Actions')
    None

The thing you are most likely to want to do from this page is search,
so the search field is focused by default.

    >>> from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup
    >>> print BeautifulSoup(browser.contents).body('script')[0]
    <script...$('field.searchtext').focus();...

But once you're on the search results page, you're quite likely to want
to scroll through the results, so the search field should not be
focused by default.

    >>> browser.getControl(name='field.searchtext').value = 'test'
    >>> browser.getControl('Search', index=0).click()
    >>> print browser.url
    http://bugs.launchpad.dev/ubuntu/+bugs?...
    >>> '.focus()' in find_main_content(browser.contents)
    False
