=Nominating a bug for a product series =

A bug can be nominated for a product series.

    >>> user_browser.open(
    ...     "http://launchpad.dev/products/firefox/+bug/4/+nominate")

Before we continue, we'll set up a second browser instance, to simulate
no-priv accessing the site from another window. Working with the same
form in different browser windows or tabs can sometimes trigger edge
case errors, and we'll give an example of one shortly.

    >>> nopriv_other_browser = setupBrowser(
    ...     auth="Basic no-priv@canonical.com:test")
    >>> nopriv_other_browser.open(
    ...     "http://launchpad.dev/products/firefox/+bug/4/+nominate")

    >>> user_browser.getControl("1.0").selected = True
    >>> nopriv_other_browser.getControl("1.0").selected = True

    >>> user_browser.getControl("Submit").click()

    >>> for tag in find_tags_by_class(
    ...     user_browser.contents, 'informational message'):
    ...     print tag
    <div...Added nominations for: Mozilla Firefox 1.0...

Now, if no-priv, having the form open in another browser window,
accidentally nominates the bug for firefox 1.0 a second time, an error
is raised.

    >>> nopriv_other_browser.getControl("Submit").click()

    >>> for tag in find_tags_by_class(nopriv_other_browser.contents, 'message'):
    ...     print tag.renderContents()
    There is 1 error.
    This bug has already been nominated for these series: 1.0

When a nomination is submitted by a privileged user, it is immediately
approved and targeted to the release.

    >>> admin_browser.open(
    ...     "http://launchpad.dev/products/firefox/+bug/4/+nominate")

    >>> admin_browser.getControl("Trunk").selected = True
    >>> admin_browser.getControl("Submit").click()

    >>> for tag in find_tags_by_class(
    ...     admin_browser.contents, 'informational message'):
    ...     print tag
    <div...Targeted bug to: Mozilla Firefox trunk...
