= Product search for pending bugwatches =

Users can search for product bugs that need a bugwatch to track an
upstream bug. This is a workflow feature for users who are adopting
upstream products. The general flow assumes a bug is marked as 'Affects
upstream', during the first round of triage. Another user can choose
'Show bugs that need to be forwarded to an upstream bug tracker' to
locate the bugs that need a bugwatch setup.


== Marking and searching for pending bugwatches ==

Sample Person is doing some bug reporting and triage for his adopted
alsa-utils project. He creates two bugs, and uses the 'Affects
upstream project' link to record that the bug is in the upstream
product. He does not provide bug watch information.

    >>> browser.addHeader("Authorization", 'Basic test@canonical.com:test')
    >>> browser.open('http://bugs.launchpad.dev/ubuntu/+source/alsa-utils/')
    >>> browser.getLink('Report a bug').click()
    >>> browser.getControl('Summary', index=0).value = 'Test Bug 1'
    >>> browser.getControl('Continue').click()
    >>> browser.getControl('Further information').value = 'Test Bug 1'
    >>> browser.getControl('Submit').click()
    >>> for message in get_feedback_messages(browser.contents):
    ...     print extract_text(message)
    Thank you for your bug report...

    >>> browser.getLink('Also affects project').click()
    >>> browser.getControl(
    ...     'I just want to register that it is upstream').selected = True
    >>> browser.getControl('Add to Bug Report').click()
    >>> browser.title
    'Bug #... in alsa-utils: ...Test Bug 1...'

Sample Person visits the advanced search page for alsa-utils, and
chooses to search for all bugs that need to be forwarded upstream.
He sees one match.

    >>> # alsa-utils must use an external bugtracker to view bugs
    >>> # forwarded to an upstream.
    >>> from lp.testing.service_usage_helpers import set_service_usage
    >>> set_service_usage('alsa-utils', bug_tracking_usage='EXTERNAL')

    >>> browser.open('http://bugs.launchpad.dev/alsa-utils/+bugs?advanced=1')
    >>> pending_bugwatch_label = (
    ...     'Show bugs that need to be forwarded to an upstream '
    ...     'bug tracker')
    >>> browser.getControl(pending_bugwatch_label).selected = True
    >>> browser.getControl('Search', index=0).click()
    >>> bug_listing = find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'buglisting')
    >>> print extract_text(bug_listing)
    Summary        Importance  Status
