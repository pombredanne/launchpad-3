Patches View
============

Patches View by Product
-----------------------

We have a view listing patches attached to bugs that target a given
product.  At first, the product is new and has no bugs.

    >>> from lp.testing import anonymous_logged_in, with_person_logged_in
    >>> with anonymous_logged_in():
    ...     anybody = factory.makePerson()
    >>> with_anybody = with_person_logged_in(anybody)
    >>> patchy_product = with_anybody(factory.makeProduct)(
    ...     name='patchy-product-1', displayname="Patchy 1")
    >>> transaction.commit()

We don't see any patches when we open the patches view.

    >>> def show_patches_view(contents):
    ...     for tag in find_tags_by_class(contents, 'listing'):
    ...         print extract_text(tag)
    ...     messages = find_tags_by_class(contents, 'informational')
    ...     if len(messages) > 0:
    ...         print extract_text(messages[0])

    >>> anon_browser.open(
    ...     'http://bugs.launchpad.dev/patchy-product-1/+patches')
    >>> show_patches_view(anon_browser.contents)
    There are no patches associated with Patchy 1 at this time.

After the product has a bug, it still doesn't show up in the patches
view, because that bug has no patch attachments.

    >>> from lp.bugs.interfaces.bugtask import (
    ...     BugTaskImportance, BugTaskStatus)
    >>> @with_anybody
    ... def make_bug(
    ...     title, product, importance=BugTaskImportance.UNDECIDED,
    ...     status=BugTaskStatus.NEW):
    ...     bug = factory.makeBug(title=title, product=product)
    ...     transaction.commit()
    ...     bug.default_bugtask.transitionToImportance(
    ...         importance, product.owner)
    ...     bug.default_bugtask.transitionToStatus(
    ...         status, product.owner)
    ...     transaction.commit()
    ...     return bug

    >>> bug_a = make_bug(title="bug_a title", product=patchy_product)
    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> anon_browser.open(
    ...     'http://bugs.launchpad.dev/patchy-product-1/+patches')
    >>> show_patches_view(anon_browser.contents)
    There are no patches associated with Patchy 1 at this time.

After we add a non-patch attachment to that bug, the patches view
still shows no patches.

    >>> with_anybody(factory.makeBugAttachment)(bug=bug_a, is_patch=False)
    <BugAttachment at...
    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> anon_browser.open('http://bugs.launchpad.dev/patchy-product-1/+patches')
    >>> show_patches_view(anon_browser.contents)
    There are no patches associated with Patchy 1 at this time.

After we add a patch attachment that's one day old, we see it in the
patches view.

    >>> patch_submitter = with_anybody(factory.makePerson)(
    ...    name="patchy-person", displayname="Patchy Person")
    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> with_anybody(factory.makeBugAttachment)(
    ...     comment="comment about patch a",
    ...     filename="patch_a.diff", owner=patch_submitter,
    ...     description="description of patch a", bug=bug_a, is_patch=True)

    >>> transaction.commit()

The page title and other wording in the page reflects the contents.

After creating some more bugs, with some non-patch and some patch
attachments, and various statuses...

    >>> bug_b = make_bug(

...the youngest patch on each bug is visible in the patch report
(except for bugs in "Fix Released" state, which aren't shown):

The default sort order is by patch age. We can sort patches by
importance and status.

    >>> anon_browser.getControl(name="orderby").value = ['-importance']
    >>> anon_browser.getControl("sort").click()
    >>> anon_browser.url
    'http://bugs.launchpad.dev/patchy-product-1/+patches?orderby=-importance'

But we can't sort by things that aren't validated by the view.

    >>> anon_browser.open('http://bugs.launchpad.dev/patchy-product-1/+patches?orderby=star-sign')
    Traceback (most recent call last):

Bugs in a product series show up in the patches view for that series.

Patches View by Distro
----------------------

The patches view also works for distributions, and it shows the target
package when viewed via a distribution.

    >>> make_bugtask(

Patches View by Distro Series
-----------------------------

The patches view works for distro series.

    >>> make_bugtask(

Patches View by Source Package
------------------------------

The patches view works for source packages too.  The view doesn't show
target package column in that case, because the package is implied.

    >>> anon_browser.open(
    ...     'http://bugs.launchpad.dev/ubuntu/+source/a52dec/+patches')

Patches View by Person and Team
-------------------------------

The patches view works for people and teams.

The patches view for a person or team will also show patches to which a person
or team is structurally subscribed.  Structural subscription searching is
thoroughly tested in bugtask-search.txt so here a single structural
subscription will be tested.

To ensure that all bugs with patches are shown for every structural
subscription a new bug and is made to affect the evolution source package for
Ubuntu.  Additionally, a patch is added to that bug report so that it will
show up in the +patches view.  Project-subscriber is then subscribed to the
evolution source package for Ubuntu and it is tested that both groups of
patches are shown.

Reaching the Patches View
-------------------------

The patches view is linked to from a portlet on the product bugs page.

    ...     print_bugfilters_portlet_unfilled,
    ...     print_bugfilters_portlet_filled)
    >>> print_bugfilters_portlet_unfilled(anon_browser, 'patchy-product-1')
    New bugs
    Open bugs
    In-progress bugs
    Critical bugs
    High importance bugs
    <BLANKLINE>
    Bugs with patches
    Bugs fixed elsewhere
    Open CVE bugs - CVE reports
    Bugs need forwarding upstream

It's also linked to from a portlet on the source package bugs page:

    >>> print_bugfilters_portlet_filled(anon_browser, 'ubuntu/+source/a52dec')
    0 New bugs
    1 Open bug
    0 In-progress bugs
    0 Critical bugs
    1 High importance bug
    <BLANKLINE>
    1 Bug with a patch
    1 Bug fixed elsewhere
    0 Open CVE bugs

And from a portlet on the distro series bugs page:

    >>> print_bugfilters_portlet_filled(anon_browser, 'ubuntu/hoary')
    2 New bugs
    2 Open bugs
    0 In-progress bugs
    0 Critical bugs
    0 High importance bugs
    0 Incomplete bugs (can expire)
    <BLANKLINE>
    1 Bug with a patch
    0 Bugs fixed elsewhere
    1 Open CVE bug - CVE report

And from a portlet on the distro bugs page:

    >>> print_bugfilters_portlet_filled(anon_browser, 'ubuntu')
    6 New bugs
    10 Open bugs
    0 In-progress bugs
    0 Critical bugs
    1 High importance bug
    0 Incomplete bugs (can expire)
    <BLANKLINE>
    6 Bugs with patches
    2 Bugs fixed elsewhere
    2 Open CVE bugs - CVE reports

The number of bugs with patches shown in the bugfilter stats portlet
might be lower than the number of bugs (bugtasks) listed on the
corresponding patches view page, because the latter shows resolved
bugs too.  N.B. only 5 bug tasks will appear at a time.

    >>> anon_browser.open('http://bugs.launchpad.dev/ubuntu/+patches')
    >>> show_patches_view(anon_browser.contents)
