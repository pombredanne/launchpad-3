    <h1>Importing a .po file from upstream</h1>

    <p>
      Many projects have either full or partial translation efforts
      outside of Launchpad. If you work on translations for such a
      project, either its partial translation in Launchpad or its
      translation for a distribution such as Ubuntu, you should import
      the externally generated translations from time to time.
    </p>

    <h2>How Launchpad prioritizes imported translation strings</h2>

    <p>To help ensure the best quality translations, Launchpad
       prioritizes translation strings differently depending on where
       they were made.
    </p>

    <p>
      In general, a translation made in Launchpad will take precedence
      over a translation imported from upstream, meaning that most
      imports will only overwrite a string if it also was an import.
    </p>

    <p>
     There are, though, two important exceptions:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        The first time that the translation of a string, in a
        particular language, is imported into Launchpad, it will take
        precedence over any existing translation made in that language
        in Launchpad.
      </li>

      <li>
        If an imported string matches the translation already made in
        Launchpad. This means that the translation will now be
        overwritten by any subsequent imports, if they differ. However,
        making a change to the translation in Launchpad would reset it
        to take precedence over imported strings.
      </li>
    </ul>

   <p>You should also take a look at Launchpad's <a href="https://help.launchpad.net/Translations/YourProject/ImportPolicy" target="_blank">
