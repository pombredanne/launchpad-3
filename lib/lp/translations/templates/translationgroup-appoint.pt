      <p>
        Here you can appoint a translation team (or an individual supervisor)
        to be responsible for a particular language within this translation
        group.  One translation team can take care of any number of languages,
        but the group can only appoint one team for any single language.  To
        avoid mistakes, this form will not allow you to appoint a new team for
        a language that already has one assigned in this group.
      </p>
      <p>
        A supervisor does not have to be a single person.  If you want to have
        several people taking care of a single language in this translation
        group, make them a team and appoint that whole team as the translation
        team.
