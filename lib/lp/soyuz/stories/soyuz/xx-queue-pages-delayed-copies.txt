Displaying delayed-copies
=========================

Delayed copies can be browsed in the UI as if they were normal uploads.

We will create a testing delayed-copy for Ubuntu/breezy-autotest.

    # Create a delayed-copy in ubuntu/breezy-autotest.
    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.distribution import IDistributionSet
    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.person import IPersonSet
    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.pocket import PackagePublishingPocket
    >>> from lp.soyuz.interfaces.queue import IPackageUploadSet
    >>> from lp.soyuz.tests.test_publishing import SoyuzTestPublisher
    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')
    >>> ubuntu = getUtility(IDistributionSet).getByName('ubuntu')
    >>> cprov = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('cprov')
    >>> cprov_private_ppa = factory.makeArchive(
    ...     private=True, owner=cprov, distribution=ubuntu,
    ...     virtualized=False, name="p3a")
    >>> stp = SoyuzTestPublisher()
    >>> stp.prepareBreezyAutotest()
    >>> [bin_hppa, bin_i386] = stp.getPubBinaries(archive=cprov_private_ppa)
    >>> build = bin_hppa.binarypackagerelease.build
    >>> breezy_autotest = ubuntu.getSeries('breezy-autotest')
    >>> stp.addFakeChroots(breezy_autotest)
    >>> delayed_copy = getUtility(IPackageUploadSet).createDelayedCopy(
    ...     archive=ubuntu.main_archive, distroseries=breezy_autotest,
    ...     pocket=PackagePublishingPocket.RELEASE, signing_key=None)
    >>> unused = delayed_copy.addSource(build.source_package_release)
    >>> unused = delayed_copy.addBuild(build)
    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> delayed_copy.acceptFromCopy()
    >>> logout()

Any user accessing the breezy-autotest ACCEPTED queue will notice the
delayed-copy. They show up in the ACCEPTED distro series queue while
they are pending processing.

    >>> anon_browser.open(
    ...     "http://launchpad.dev/ubuntu/breezy-autotest/+queue")
    >>> anon_browser.getControl(
    ...     name="queue_state", index=0).displayValue = ['Accepted']
    >>> anon_browser.getControl("Update").click()

It's is listed as a normal upload, however there is no link to the
'changesfile'.

    >>> for row in find_tags_by_class(anon_browser.contents, "queue-row"):
    ...     print extract_text(row)
    Package                           Version  Component Section Priority Sets Pocket When
    foo, foo (delayed) (source, i386) 666      main      base    low      ...

    >>> anon_browser.getLink('foo, foo')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    LinkNotFoundError

On the corresponding expandable area, below the row, there is no file
information, since the delayed-copy is still pending processing. A
user can simply view where the delayed copy came from.

    >>> print extract_text(
    ...     first_tag_by_class(anon_browser.contents,
    ...                        'queue-%s' % delayed_copy.id))
    Copied from PPA named p3a for Celso Providelo

The delayed-copy source archive is not linked, since the requester has
no permission to view it.

    >>> anon_browser.getLink('PPA named p3a for Celso Providelo')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    LinkNotFoundError

While the delayed-copy is still in ACCEPTED state, i.e not processed,
authenticated users with permission to view the archive from where the
delayed-copy was issued can additionally access a link to its original
archive, nothing else.

    >>> cprov_browser = setupBrowser(
    ...       auth="Basic celso.providelo@canonical.com:cprov")
    >>> cprov_browser.open(anon_browser.url)

    >>> for row in find_tags_by_class(cprov_browser.contents, "queue-row"):
    ...     print extract_text(row)
    Package                           Version  Component Section Priority Sets Pocket When
    foo, foo (delayed) (source, i386) 666      main      base    low      ...

    >>> anon_browser.getLink('foo, foo')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    LinkNotFoundError

    >>> print extract_text(
    ...     first_tag_by_class(cprov_browser.contents,
    ...                        'queue-%s' % delayed_copy.id))
    Copied from PPA named p3a for Celso Providelo

    >>> print cprov_browser.getLink('PPA named p3a for Celso Providelo').url
    http://launchpad.dev/~cprov/+archive/p3a

When the delayed-copy is processed (moved to DONE queue) its contents
become available to everyone.

    # Process the delayed-copy using an external script call.  Since some
    # DB objects that have no security adapter are modified during the
    # delayed copy, the modification must be done in Zopeless mode.
    >>> import os.path
    >>> from canonical.config import config
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests.script import run_script
    >>> script = os.path.join(config.root, "scripts/process-accepted.py")
    >>> result, stdout, stderr = run_script(script, ["ubuntu"])
    >>> if result != 0:
    ...     print stderr

Any user can access the DONE queue and access the delayed-copy
'changesfile' and view its files in the expandable area.

    >>> anon_browser.getControl(
    ...     name="queue_state", index=0).displayValue = ['Done']
    >>> anon_browser.getControl("Update").click()

    >>> print anon_browser.getLink('foo, foo').url
    http://.../.../foo_666_source.changes

    >>> extra_information = find_tags_by_class(
    ...     anon_browser.contents, 'queue-%s' % delayed_copy.id)
    >>> for info in extra_information:
    ...     print extract_text(info)
    foo_666.dsc (28 bytes)
    foo-bin_666_all.deb (18 bytes)   666   main   base   standard
