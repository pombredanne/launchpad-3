DIST-UPGRADE upload
===================

This test will check the upload of dist-upgrade tarballs

    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.distribution import IDistributionSet

    >>> from lp.archiveuploader.nascentupload import NascentUpload
    >>> from lp.archiveuploader.tests import datadir, getPolicy

    >>> ubuntutest = getUtility(IDistributionSet)['ubuntutest']
    >>> breezy_autotest = ubuntutest['breezy-autotest']

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests import import_public_test_keys
    >>> import_public_test_keys()

Login as an admin.

    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')

First, test the rejection of a missapplied changesfile name:

    >>> sync_policy = getPolicy(
    ...     name='sync', distro='ubuntutest', distroseries=None)

    >>> from lp.services.log.logger import FakeLogger
    >>> upload = NascentUpload.from_changesfile_path(
    ...     datadir('dist-upgrader/dist-upgrader_20060302.0120.changes'),
    ...     sync_policy, FakeLogger())
    DEBUG dist-upgrader_20060302.0120.changes can be unsigned.
    >>> upload.process()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    EarlyReturnUploadError: An error occurred that prevented further
    processing.

Now do a proper upload into the system.

    >>> insecure_policy = getPolicy(
    ...     name='insecure', distro='ubuntutest', distroseries=None)

    >>> upload = NascentUpload.from_changesfile_path(
    ...     datadir('dist-upgrader/dist-upgrader_20060302.0120_all.changes'),
    ...     insecure_policy, FakeLogger())
    DEBUG Verifying signature on dist-upgrader_20060302.0120_all.changes

    >>> upload.process()
    DEBUG Beginning processing.
    DEBUG Verifying the changes file.
    DEBUG Verifying files in upload.
    DEBUG Single Custom Upload detected.
    DEBUG Finished checking upload.

It was not rejected.

    >>> upload.is_rejected
    False

    >>> success = upload.do_accept()
    DEBUG Creating queue entry
    DEBUG Setting it to ACCEPTED
    DEBUG Building recipients list.
    DEBUG Adding recipient: 'Foo Bar <foo.bar@canonical.com>'
    ...
    DEBUG Sent a mail:
    ...
    DEBUG signer of the above package.

And all things worked.

    >>> success
    True

    >>> print upload.rejection_message

We need to commit the transaction to be able to use the librarian files.
XXX: flush_database_updates() shouldn't be needed. This seems to be

    >>> transaction.commit()

Let's check how queue tool handles dist_upgrader uploads:

    >>> import subprocess
    >>> import os
    >>> import sys
    >>> from canonical.config import config

    >>> script = os.path.join(
    ...     config.root, "scripts", "ftpmaster-tools", "queue")


Rejecting item from accepted queue (very unlikely, normally it would
be rejecting from unapproved or new, fix bug #54649):

    >>> process = subprocess.Popen([
    ...     sys.executable, script,
    ...     "-Q", "accepted",
    ...     "-s", "breezy-autotest", "reject", "dist",
    ...     "-d", "ubuntutest", "-M"],
    ...     stderr=subprocess.PIPE,
    ...     stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
    >>> stdout, stderr = process.communicate()
    >>> process.returncode
    0
    >>> print stdout
    Initializing connection to queue accepted
    ...
    Rejecting dist-upgrader_20060302.0120_all.tar.gz
    ...


Accepting from rejected queue (ressurecting an reject upload is also
very unlikely, however it's only for testing purpose, fix #54649):

    >>> process = subprocess.Popen([sys.executable, script, "-Q", "rejected",
    ...                             "-s", "breezy-autotest", "accept", "dist",
    ...                             "-d", "ubuntutest", "-M"],
    ...                            stderr=subprocess.PIPE,
    ...                            stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
    >>> stdout, stderr = process.communicate()
    >>> process.returncode
    0
    >>> print stdout
    Initializing connection to queue rejected
    ...
    Accepting dist-upgrader_20060302.0120_all.tar.gz
    ...


Let's use the script to fetch the dist-upgrader upload:

    >>> process = subprocess.Popen([sys.executable, script, "-Q", "accepted",
    ...                             "-s", "breezy-autotest", "fetch", "dist",
    ...                             "-d", "ubuntutest"],
    ...                            stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
    >>> stdout, stderr = process.communicate()
    >>> process.returncode
    0
    >>> print stdout
    Initializing connection to queue accepted
    Running: "fetch dist"

Check if the files were written:

    >>> os.path.exists('dist-upgrader_20060302.0120_all.changes')
    True
    >>> os.path.exists('dist-upgrader_20060302.0120_all.tar.gz')
    True

Cleanup the mess:

    >>> os.remove('dist-upgrader_20060302.0120_all.changes')
    >>> os.remove('dist-upgrader_20060302.0120_all.tar.gz')


Inspect the QUEUE looking for an ACCEPTED entry corresponding to the
previous upload:

    >>> from lp.soyuz.enums import PackageUploadStatus
    >>> queue_item = breezy_autotest.getPackageUploads(
    ...      status=PackageUploadStatus.ACCEPTED)[0]
    >>> queue_item.customfiles[0].libraryfilealias.filename
    u'dist-upgrader_20060302.0120_all.tar.gz'

Do the publish, i.e process the CustomUpload writing the tarball in
the archive.  The umask must be 022 in order to perform the upload.

    >>> old_mask = os.umask(022)
    >>> pub_records = queue_item.realiseUpload()
    >>> print '%03o' % os.umask(old_mask)
    022

Check what was published in the target directory:

    >>> import os
    >>> archive_dir = '/var/tmp/archive/'
    >>> upgrade_dir = (
    ...     'ubuntutest/dists/breezy-autotest/main/dist-upgrader-all')
    >>> target_dir = os.path.join(archive_dir, upgrade_dir)
    >>> content = sorted(os.listdir(target_dir))
    >>> content
    ['20060302.0120', 'current']

Check the content of the directories published and the integrity of
the 'current' symbolic link.

    >>> real_path = os.path.join(target_dir, '20060302.0120')
    >>> current_path = os.path.join(target_dir, 'current')

    >>> os.path.islink(current_path)
    True

    >>> os.path.join(target_dir, os.readlink(current_path)) == real_path
    True

    >>> sorted(os.listdir(real_path))
    ['ReleaseAnouncement', 'dapper.tar.gz']


Pre-publication version checks
------------------------------

Dist-Upgrader version is checked before installing any files in the
archive.

If any problem happen during the custom publication, the error will be
printed and the queue item will remain in ACCEPTED queue waiting for
manual intervention.

    >>> insecure_policy = getPolicy(
    ...     name='insecure', distro='ubuntutest', distroseries=None)

    >>> upload = NascentUpload.from_changesfile_path(
    ...     datadir('dist-upgrader/dist-upgrader_20070219.1234_all.changes'),
    ...     insecure_policy, FakeLogger())
    DEBUG Verifying signature on dist-upgrader_20070219.1234_all.changes

    >>> upload.process()
    DEBUG Beginning processing.
    DEBUG Verifying the changes file.
    DEBUG Verifying files in upload.
    DEBUG Single Custom Upload detected.
    DEBUG Finished checking upload.

    >>> success = upload.do_accept()
    DEBUG Creating queue entry
    DEBUG Setting it to ACCEPTED
    DEBUG Building recipients list.
    DEBUG Adding recipient: 'Foo Bar <foo.bar@canonical.com>'
    ...
    DEBUG Sent a mail:
    ...
    DEBUG signer of the above package.

Make the just-uploaded librarian file visible:

    >>> transaction.commit()

Check current archive status:

    >>> previous_content = sorted(os.listdir(target_dir))
    >>> previous_content
    ['20060302.0120', 'current']

Publish the custom upload:

    >>> pub_records = upload.queue_root.realiseUpload(FakeLogger())
    DEBUG Publishing custom dist-upgrader_20070219.1234_all.tar.gz to
    ubuntutest/breezy-autotest
    ERROR Queue item ignored: bad version found in
    '.../dist-upgrader_20070219.1234_all.tar.gz': Could not parse version: Bad
    upstream version format foobar

Check if the queue item remained in ACCEPTED and not cruft was
inserted in the archive:

    >>> upload.queue_root.status.name
    'ACCEPTED'

    >>> content = sorted(os.listdir(target_dir))
    >>> content == previous_content
    True

Remove the directory to keep the test working.

    >>> import shutil
    >>> shutil.rmtree(target_dir)


Dist Upgrader to PPA
--------------------

Custom uploads for PPAs should works as expected, i.e, publish its
files in the respective PPA location.

    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.person import IPersonSet
    >>> from lp.soyuz.enums import ArchivePurpose
    >>> from lp.soyuz.interfaces.archive import IArchiveSet

    >>> name16 = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName("name16")
    >>> foobar_archive = getUtility(IArchiveSet).new(
    ...     distribution=ubuntutest, purpose=ArchivePurpose.PPA,
    ...     owner=name16)

    >>> insecure_policy.archive = foobar_archive

    >>> ppa_upload = NascentUpload.from_changesfile_path(
    ...     datadir('dist-upgrader/dist-upgrader_20060302.0120_all.changes'),
    ...     insecure_policy, FakeLogger())
    DEBUG Verifying signature on dist-upgrader_20060302.0120_all.changes

    >>> ppa_upload.process()
    DEBUG Beginning processing.
    DEBUG Verifying the changes file.
    DEBUG Verifying files in upload.
    DEBUG Single Custom Upload detected.
    DEBUG Finished checking upload.

    >>> success = ppa_upload.do_accept()
    DEBUG Creating queue entry
    DEBUG Setting it to ACCEPTED
    DEBUG Building recipients list.
    DEBUG Adding recipient: 'Foo Bar <foo.bar@canonical.com>'
    DEBUG Sent a mail:
    ...
    DEBUG PPA package.

    >>> transaction.commit()

The upload task requires that the umask be 022, otherwise things will end up
with the wrong permission.

    >>> old_mask = os.umask(022)
    >>> pub_records = ppa_upload.queue_root.realiseUpload(FakeLogger())
    DEBUG Publishing custom dist-upgrader_20060302.0120_all.tar.gz to
    ubuntutest/breezy-autotest
    >>> ignore = os.umask(old_mask)

    >>> ppa_root = config.personalpackagearchive.root
    >>> ppa_dir = os.path.join(ppa_root, 'name16', 'ppa')
    >>> target_dir = os.path.join(ppa_dir, upgrade_dir)
    >>> content = sorted(os.listdir(target_dir))
    >>> content
    ['20060302.0120', 'current']

Remove the directory to keep the test working.

    >>> import shutil
    >>> shutil.rmtree(target_dir)
