Build Candidates Lookup
=======================


IDistroSeries.getSourcesPublishedForAllArchives method is used by the
Build System ("queue-builder" to be precise) to retrieve the source
publications that should be considered in its checks.

'queue-builder' will verify if each retrieved publication has an
associated Build and BuildQueue records based on their DSC and
P-a-s (Package-architecture-specific) information. See further details
in buildd-queuebuilder.txt.

This document explains which source publishing information are
returned by the method depending on the archive state.

First, we will create some functions to help creating and inspecting
publications for a given distroseries:

    >>> from canonical.database.constants import UTC_NOW
    >>> from lp.soyuz.model.publishing import (
    ...     SourcePackagePublishingHistory)
    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.distribution import IDistributionSet
    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.person import IPersonSet
    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.pocket import PackagePublishingPocket
    >>> from lp.soyuz.enums import ArchivePurpose, PackagePublishingStatus
    >>> from lp.soyuz.interfaces.archive import IArchiveSet

    >>> ubuntu = getUtility(IDistributionSet)['ubuntu']
    >>> cprov = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('cprov')
    >>> partner_archive = getUtility(IArchiveSet).getByDistroPurpose(
    ...     distribution=ubuntu, purpose=ArchivePurpose.PARTNER)

    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')
    >>> copy_archive = factory.makeArchive(
    ...     ubuntu, cprov, 'test-rebuild', ArchivePurpose.COPY)
    >>> login(ANONYMOUS)

    >>> dspr = ubuntu.getSourcePackage('mozilla-firefox').getVersion('0.9')
    >>> the_spr = dspr.sourcepackagerelease

    >>> initial_candidates = []

Creating a single source publishing record:

    >>> def create_publication(distroseries, pocket, archive, status):
    ...     SourcePackagePublishingHistory(
    ...         sourcepackagerelease=the_spr, component=the_spr.component,
    ...         section=the_spr.section, datecreated=UTC_NOW,
    ...         distroseries=distroseries, status=status,
    ...         pocket=pocket, archive=archive,
    ...         sourcepackagename=the_spr.sourcepackagename)

Create a collection of source publishing records in different
archives, pockets and statuses. This function creates:

 * 1 PUBLISHED and 1 PENDING records in RELEASE pocket, main_archive;
 * 1 PUBLISHED and 1 PENDING records in UPDATES pocket, main_archive;
 * 1 PUBLISHED and 1 PENDING records in RELEASE pocket, PPA archive;
 * 1 PUBLISHED and 1 PENDING records in RELEASE pocket, PARTNER archive;
 * 1 PUBLISHED and 1 PENDING records in RELEASE pocket, COPY archive;

    >>> def create_sample_publications(distroseries):
    ...     create_publication(
    ...         distroseries, PackagePublishingPocket.RELEASE,
    ...         distroseries.main_archive, PackagePublishingStatus.PUBLISHED)
    ...     create_publication(
    ...         distroseries, PackagePublishingPocket.RELEASE,
    ...         distroseries.main_archive, PackagePublishingStatus.PENDING)
    ...     create_publication(
    ...         distroseries, PackagePublishingPocket.UPDATES,
    ...         distroseries.main_archive, PackagePublishingStatus.PUBLISHED)
    ...     create_publication(
    ...         distroseries, PackagePublishingPocket.UPDATES,
    ...         distroseries.main_archive, PackagePublishingStatus.PENDING)
    ...     create_publication(
    ...         distroseries, PackagePublishingPocket.RELEASE,
    ...         cprov.archive, PackagePublishingStatus.PUBLISHED)
    ...     create_publication(
    ...         distroseries, PackagePublishingPocket.RELEASE,
    ...         cprov.archive, PackagePublishingStatus.PENDING)
    ...     create_publication(
    ...         distroseries, PackagePublishingPocket.RELEASE,
    ...         partner_archive, PackagePublishingStatus.PUBLISHED)
    ...     create_publication(
    ...         distroseries, PackagePublishingPocket.RELEASE,
    ...         partner_archive, PackagePublishingStatus.PENDING)
    ...     create_publication(
    ...         distroseries, PackagePublishingPocket.RELEASE,
    ...         copy_archive, PackagePublishingStatus.PUBLISHED)
    ...     create_publication(
    ...         distroseries, PackagePublishingPocket.RELEASE,
    ...         copy_archive, PackagePublishingStatus.PENDING)

This function will store previous publishing records that will be
ignored later when inspecting the example results (sampledata already
contains other records that are not relevant for this example).

    >>> def reset_candidates(distroseries):
    ...      global initial_candidates
    ...      initial_candidates =  [
    ...          pub.id for pub in
    ...          distroseries.getSourcesPublishedForAllArchives()]


Inspect IDistroSeries.getSourcesPublishedForAllArchives ignoring
previous results and printing a lines containing:

   <STATUS> <POCKET> <IS_MAIN_ARCHIVE>

for each new publishing record.

    >>> def inspect_new_candidates(distroseries):
    ...     global initial_candidates
    ...     for pub in distroseries.getSourcesPublishedForAllArchives():
    ...         if pub.id in initial_candidates:
    ...             continue
    ...         arch_purpose = pub.archive.purpose.name
    ...         print pub.status.name, pub.pocket.name, arch_purpose

Finally, a shortcut to do all the dirty-job:

    >>> def probe_candidates(distroseries):
    ...     reset_candidates(distroseries)
    ...     create_sample_publications(distroseries)
    ...     inspect_new_candidates(distroseries)


CURRENT DistroSeries
--------------------

For a distroseries in CURRENT state, which means STABLE, we expect to
retrieve the following publications:

 * All PPA publications (even those targeted to the RELEASE
   pocket, since we don't allow post-release pocket in PPA).
 * Only those targeted to post-release pockets (UPDATES, SECURITY,
   BACKPORTS and PROPOSED) in main_archive (default ubuntu archive)
 * All Partner archive publications since these can be targeted to
   RELEASE.

    >>> warty = ubuntu['warty']
    >>> warty.status.name
    'CURRENT'

Both PUBLISHED and PENDING publication records are returned, this is
important to accomplish building-accepted-sources specification:

   https://launchpad.net/soyuz/+spec/build-unpublished-source

This will give us only 6 of the test publications:

    >>> probe_candidates(warty)
    PUBLISHED UPDATES PRIMARY
    PENDING UPDATES PRIMARY
    PUBLISHED RELEASE PPA
    PENDING RELEASE PPA
    PUBLISHED RELEASE PARTNER
    PENDING RELEASE PARTNER


DEVELOPMENT DistroSeries
------------------------

For a distroseries in DEVELOPMENT state, which means UNSTABLE, we
expect to retrieve the following publications:

 * All PPA publications
 * All main archive publications, including RELEASE and post-release pockets

    >>> hoary = ubuntu['hoary']
    >>> hoary.status.name
    'DEVELOPMENT'

Note that, also the publications targeted to post-release pockets are
returned, but they won't be dispatched until they can be accepted (see
IDistroSeries.canUploadToPocket). This nuance will be more explored
when fixing #67790 when we will start publishing and building
post-release pocket in FROZEN state.

Summing up, all the 8 test publications will be returned from the lookup:

    >>> probe_candidates(hoary)
    PUBLISHED RELEASE PRIMARY
    PENDING RELEASE PRIMARY
    PUBLISHED UPDATES PRIMARY
    PENDING UPDATES PRIMARY
    PUBLISHED RELEASE PPA
    PENDING RELEASE PPA
    PUBLISHED RELEASE PARTNER
    PENDING RELEASE PARTNER
