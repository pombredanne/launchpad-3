The `ArchiveArch` table facilitates the association of archives and
processor families. This allows a user to specify (or limit) what
processors the source packages in a certain archives will be built
for.

    >>> from lp.soyuz.enums import ArchivePurpose
    >>> rebuild_archive = factory.makeArchive(
    ...     purpose=ArchivePurpose.COPY, name='archivearch-test')

The rebuild archive has no associated processor families yet.

    >>> from lp.soyuz.interfaces.archivearch import IArchiveArchSet
    >>> aa_set = getUtility(IArchiveArchSet)
    >>> rset = aa_set.getByArchive(rebuild_archive)
    >>> print rset.count()
    0

The utility allows us to associate archives with processor families
and we'll tie the rebuild archive to the 'amd64' processor family.

    # Retrieve the 'amd64' and 'x86' processor families available
    # in the sampledata.
    >>> from lp.soyuz.interfaces.processor import IProcessorFamilySet
    >>> amd64 = getUtility(IProcessorFamilySet).getByName('amd64')
    >>> x86 = getUtility(IProcessorFamilySet).getByName('x86')

    >>> ignore = aa_set.new(rebuild_archive, amd64)

Now we have an association between the rebuild archive to the 'amd64'
processor family.

    >>> archive_arches = aa_set.getByArchive(rebuild_archive)
    >>> archive_arches.count()
    1

    >>> [archive_arch] = list(archive_arches)
    >>> print archive_arch.archive.name
    archivearch-test

    >>> print archive_arch.processorfamily.name
    amd64

Let's add another association for 'x86' processor family.

    >>> ignore = aa_set.new(rebuild_archive, x86)

    >>> archive_arches = aa_set.getByArchive(rebuild_archive)
    >>> print archive_arches.count()
    2

The result follows the creation order, so the just-created
`ArchiveArch` comes last.

    >>> [old, x86_archive_arch] = list(archive_arches)
    >>> print x86_archive_arch.archive.name
    archivearch-test

    >>> print x86_archive_arch.processorfamily.name
    x86

Last but not least, we query for a specific association.

    >>> archive_arches = aa_set.getByArchive(rebuild_archive, amd64)
    >>> archive_arches.count()
    1

    >>> [amd64_archive_arch] = list(archive_arches)
    >>> print amd64_archive_arch.archive.name
    archivearch-test

    >>> print amd64_archive_arch.processorfamily.name
    amd64
