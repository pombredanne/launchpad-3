= Package Relationship Model =

We call "package relationship" the DSC field which describes relation
between the package in question and others availble:

For sources DSC provides:

 * builddepends
 * builddependsindep

For binaries we have:

 * shlibdeps
 * depends
 * recommends
 * suggests
 * conflicts
 * replaces
 * provides

Those lines contain a list of comma-separated relationship where each
element follows this format:

    $NAME [($OPERATOR $VERSION)]

For example:

  >>> relationship_line = (
  ...    'gcc-3.4-base, libc6 (>= 2.3.2.ds1-4), gcc-3.4 ( = 3.4.1-4sarge1)')

Launchpad models package relationship elements via the
IPackageRelationship instance. We use deb822 to parse the relationship
lines:

  >>> from debian.deb822 import PkgRelation

PkgRelation.parse_relations returns a 'list of lists of dicts' as:

  [ [{'name': '$NAME', 'version': ('$OPERATOR', '$VERSION')}],
    [{'name': '$NAME', 'version': ('$OPERATOR', '$VERSION')}],
    ... ]

So we need to massage its result into the form we prefer:

  >>> def parse_relations(line):
  ...     for (rel,) in PkgRelation.parse_relations(relationship_line):
  ...         if rel['version'] is None:
  ...             operator, version = '', ''
  ...         else:
  ...             operator, version = rel['version']
  ...         yield rel['name'], version, operator
  >>> parsed_relationships = list(parse_relations(relationship_line))
  >>> parsed_relationships
  [('gcc-3.4-base', '', ''), ('libc6', '2.3.2.ds1-4', '>='), ('gcc-3.4', '3.4.1-4sarge1', '=')]

Now for each parsed element we can build an IPackageRelationship:

  >>> from lp.soyuz.browser.packagerelationship import PackageRelationship
  >>> from lp.soyuz.interfaces.packagerelationship import IPackageRelationship
  >>> from lp.testing import verifyObject

  >>> name, version, operator = parsed_relationships[1]
  >>> fake_url = 'http://host/path'

  >>> pkg_relationship = PackageRelationship(
  ...     name, operator, version, url=fake_url)

  >>> verifyObject(IPackageRelationship, pkg_relationship)
  True

  >>> pkg_relationship.name
  'libc6'
  >>> pkg_relationship.operator
  '>='
  >>> pkg_relationship.version
  '2.3.2.ds1-4'
  >>> pkg_relationship.url == fake_url
  True
