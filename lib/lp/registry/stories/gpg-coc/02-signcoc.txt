Signing a Code of Conduct
=========================

Sample person has never signed a code of conduct.

    >>> browser = setupBrowser(auth='Basic test@canonical.com:test')
    >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~name12/+codesofconduct')
    >>> print extract_text(find_main_content(browser.contents))

    # A helper function for reading a code-of-conduct file.
    >>> import os
    >>> def read_file(filename):
    ...     path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), filename)
    ...     file_object = open(path)
    ...     # Change this to a with-statement when we switch to Python 2.5.
    ...     try:
    ...         return file_object.read()
    ...     finally:
    ...         file_object.close()


Code of Conduct registration problems
=====================================

Sample Person tries unsuccessfully to register a truncated code of conduct.

    >>> truncated_coc = read_file('truncated_coc.asc')
    >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/codeofconduct/1.1/+sign')
    >>> browser.getControl('Signed Code').value = truncated_coc
    >>> browser.getControl('Continue').click()
    >>> print_errors(browser.contents)
    There is 1 error.
    The signed text does not match the Code of Conduct. Make sure that you
    signed the correct text (white space differences are acceptable).

Sample Person tries unsuccessfully to register an old version of the code.

    >>> coc_version_1_0 = read_file('10_coc.asc')
    >>> browser.getControl('Signed Code').value = coc_version_1_0
    >>> browser.getControl('Continue').click()
    >>> print_errors(browser.contents)
    There is 1 error.
    The signed text does not match the Code of Conduct. Make sure that you
    signed the correct text (white space differences are acceptable).


Sample Person tries to access the old version page to sign it, and is informed
that there is a new version available.

    >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/codeofconduct/1.0/+sign')
    >>> browser.getLink('the current version').click()
    >>> print browser.url
    http://launchpad.dev/codeofconduct/1.1

    >>> browser.getLink('Sign it').click()
    >>> print browser.url
    http://launchpad.dev/codeofconduct/1.1/+sign


Code of Conduct registration
============================

Sample Person registers the code of conduct, using a reformatted copy which
has leading spaces removed.  This succeeds because the words the same and
appear in the same order.

    >>> reformatted_coc = read_file('reformatted_11_coc.asc')
    >>> browser.getControl('Signed Code').value = reformatted_coc
    >>> browser.getControl('Continue').click()
    >>> print browser.url
    http://launchpad.dev/~name12/+codesofconduct

And now Sample Person's Codes of Conduct page shows that he's signed it.

    >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~name12/+codesofconduct')
    >>> print extract_text(find_main_content(browser.contents))
