= Featured Projects =

We maintain a list of featured projects, which are displayed on the home
page and managed via a special admin-only page.

   >>> MANAGE_LINK = "Manage featured project list"


== The home page listing ==

Featured projects are visible to everyone on the home page. One poject is
featured as "project of the day" depending on the current day. As we do not
know the current day, we replace that selection method in the view with a
constant value.

    >>> def fake_get_day_of_year():
    ...     return 4
    >>> from lp.registry.browser.root import LaunchpadRootIndexView
    >>> LaunchpadRootIndexView._get_day_of_year = staticmethod(
    ...                                                 fake_get_day_of_year)
    >>> anon_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/')
    >>> featured = find_tag_by_id(anon_browser.contents, 'homepage-featured')
    >>> print extract_text(featured.h2)
    Featured projects

We show the featured projects in our sample data, the "project of the day" is
"GNOME" and it is listed first:

    >>> for link in featured.findAll('a'):
    ...     print extract_text(link)
    GNOME
    Gnome Applets
    Bazaar
    Mozilla Firefox
    Gentoo
    GNOME Terminal
    the Mozilla Project
    Mozilla Thunderbird
    Ubuntu
    Browse all ... projects

== Adding a featured project ==

Anonymous users cannot see the link to administer featured projects:

    >>> anon_browser.getLink(MANAGE_LINK)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    LinkNotFoundError

A user without privileges cannot see the administration link, either:

    >>> user_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/')
    >>> user_browser.getLink(MANAGE_LINK)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    LinkNotFoundError

But Foo Bar, who is an administrator, can see the management link:

    >>> admin_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/')
    >>> admin_browser.getLink(MANAGE_LINK).click()
    >>> admin_browser.url
    'http://launchpad.dev/+featuredprojects'

No Privilege persons is denied access to this page:

    >>> user_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/+featuredprojects')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    Unauthorized: ...

Administrators can add a project. Here Foo Bar adds apache as a featured
project:

    >>> admin_browser.getControl('Add project').value = 'apache'
    >>> admin_browser.getControl('Update').click()
    >>> admin_browser.url
    'http://launchpad.dev/'
    >>> featured = find_tag_by_id(admin_browser.contents, 'homepage-featured')
    >>> 'Apache' in extract_text(featured)
    True

Just to be certain, we will iterate the list as we did before and see
that Apache has been added. Because the list has changed, a different project
is now at index '4' and is therefore displayed as the top project:

    >>> anon_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/')
    >>> featured = find_tag_by_id(anon_browser.contents, 'homepage-featured')
    >>> for link in featured.findAll('a'):
    ...     print extract_text(link)
    Gentoo
    Apache
    Gnome Applets
    Bazaar
    Mozilla Firefox
    GNOME
    GNOME Terminal
    the Mozilla Project
    Mozilla Thunderbird
    Ubuntu
    Browse all ... projects


== Removing a project ==

    >>> admin_browser.getLink(MANAGE_LINK).click()
    >>> admin_browser.getControl('Apache').click()
    >>> admin_browser.getControl('Update').click()
    >>> admin_browser.url
    'http://launchpad.dev/'
    >>> featured = find_tag_by_id(admin_browser.contents, 'homepage-featured')
    >>> 'Apache' in extract_text(featured)
    False

Just to be certain, we will iterate the list as we did before and see
that Apache has been removed:

    >>> anon_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/')
    >>> featured = find_tag_by_id(anon_browser.contents, 'homepage-featured')
    >>> for link in featured.findAll('a'):
    ...     print extract_text(link)
    GNOME
    Gnome Applets
    Bazaar
    Mozilla Firefox
    Gentoo
    GNOME Terminal
