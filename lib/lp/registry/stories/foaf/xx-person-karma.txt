Launchpad assigns a person karma for performing actions beneficial to
the community.  A person's current total karma is available on their
profile page.

    >>> content = find_main_content(anon_browser.contents)
    >>> karma = find_tag_by_id(content, 'karma-total')
    >>> print karma.renderContents()
