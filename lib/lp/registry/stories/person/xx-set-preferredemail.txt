A person's contact email address
================================

A person may have many confirmed email address which he may use to
login with, but only one email address will be the contact email
address.


Setting the contact email address
=================================

Sample Person chooses to change his contact email address to the
address he prefers to login with.

    >>> browser = setupBrowser(auth='Basic testing@canonical.com:test')
    >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~name12')
    >>> browser.getLink(url='+editemails').click()
    >>> print browser.url
    http://launchpad.dev/~name12/+editemails
    >>> print browser.title
    Change your e-mail settings...

Sample Person has a second browser open to the same page; maybe he is
absent minded.

    >>> second_browser = setupBrowser(auth='Basic testing@canonical.com:test')
    >>> second_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~name12/+editemails')

His confirmed email addresses are listed for him to manage. His
contact email address is selected, and always first.

    >>> print_radio_button_field(browser.contents, "VALIDATED_SELECTED")
    (*) test@canonical.com
    ( ) testing@canonical.com

Sample Persons selects his testing email address and submits his choice
with the "Set as Contact Address" button.

    >>> browser.getControl('testing@canonical.com').selected = True
    >>> browser.getControl('Set as Contact Address').click()

    >>> for msg in get_feedback_messages(browser.contents):
    ...     print msg
    Your contact address has been changed to: testing@canonical.com

His testing email address is now first in the list and selected
as his contact address.

    >>> print_radio_button_field(browser.contents, "VALIDATED_SELECTED")
    (*) testing@canonical.com
    ( ) test@canonical.com

In a moment of deja vu, Sample Person returns to his second browser,
selects his testing email address again, then submits his choice. There
is no change; he sees a message explaining that testing was already his
contact address.

    >>> second_browser.getControl('testing@canonical.com').selected = True
    >>> second_browser.getControl('Set as Contact Address').click()

    >>> for msg in get_feedback_messages(second_browser.contents):
    ...     print msg
    testing@canonical.com is already set as your contact address.
