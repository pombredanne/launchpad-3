= The set of people and teams =

The set of people and teams in Launchpad is represented by the
collection found at /people.  By default it lists the (up to) 50
people with the most karma, not including people with no karma.

    >>> people = webservice.get("/people").jsonBody()
    >>> len(people['entries'])
    4


== Custom operations ==

But it also offer operations to filter that list.  For example, the
find operation will search for people and teams matching the given
search text.

    >>> search = webservice.get(
    ...     "/people?ws.op=find&text=salgado").jsonBody()
    >>> sorted(person['name'] for person in search['entries'])
    [u'salgado']

There are also operations to search only for people or only for teams.

    >>> search = webservice.get(
    ...     "/people?ws.op=findTeam&text=salgado").jsonBody()
    >>> sorted(person['name'] for person in search['entries'])
    []

    >>> search = webservice.get(
    ...     "/people?ws.op=findPerson&text=salgado").jsonBody()
    >>> sorted(person['name'] for person in search['entries'])
    [u'salgado']

    >>> results = webservice.get(
    ...     "/people?ws.op=findPerson&text="
    ...     "&created_after=2008-06-27&created_before=2008-07-01").jsonBody()
    >>> sorted(person['name'] for person in results['entries'])
    [u'bac']

It's possible to get a list of teams by virtue of which a person
belongs to a particular team.

    # XXX: salgado, 2008-08-01: Commented because method has been Unexported;
    # it should be re-enabled after the operation is exported again.
    # >>> response = webservice.named_get(
    # ...     '/~salgado', 'findPathToTeam',
    # ...     team=webservice.getAbsoluteUrl('/~mailing-list-experts'))

    # >>> path = response.jsonBody()
    # >>> path['total_size']
    # 2
    # >>> [person['name'] for person in path['entries']]
    # [u'admins', u'mailing-list-experts']

If you know the email address of a person/team, it's possible to
retrieve it using that email.

    >>> daf = webservice.get(
    ...     "/people?ws.op=getByEmail&email=daf@canonical.com").jsonBody()
    >>> daf['name']
    u'daf'

When looking up a person by email address, you have to provide a valid
email address.

    >>> print webservice.get(
    ...     "/people?ws.op=getByEmail&email=daf@")
    HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
    ...
    email: Invalid email 'daf@'.
