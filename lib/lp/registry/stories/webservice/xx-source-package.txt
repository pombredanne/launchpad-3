Source Package API
==================


Prelude
-------

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.distribution import (
    ...     IDistributionSet)
    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.distroseries import (
    ...     IDistroSeriesSet)
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces.launchpad import (
    ...     ILaunchpadCelebrities)
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.testing.pages import webservice_for_person
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.webapp.interfaces import OAuthPermission
    >>> from lazr.restful.testing.webservice import pprint_entry


Getting source packages
-----------------------

We can get source packages that are bound to a distribution series from the
distribution series.

    >>> hoary = webservice.get('/ubuntu/hoary').jsonBody()
    >>> evolution = webservice.named_get(
    ...     hoary['self_link'], 'getSourcePackage',
    ...     name='evolution').jsonBody()

    >>> pprint_entry(evolution)
    bug_reported_acknowledgement: None
    bug_reporting_guidelines: None
    displayname: u'evolution in Ubuntu Hoary'
    distribution_link: u'http://.../ubuntu'
    distroseries_link: u'http://.../ubuntu/hoary'
    latest_published_component_name: u'main'
    name: u'evolution'
    official_bug_tags: []
    productseries_link: u'http://.../evolution/trunk'
    resource_type_link: ...
    self_link: u'http://.../ubuntu/hoary/+source/evolution'


Getting official branches
-------------------------

Then we can get the branches that are bound to various pockets of this
distribution series. By default, there are none bound to evolution.

    >>> branch = webservice.named_get(
    ...     evolution['self_link'], 'getBranch', pocket='Release').jsonBody()
    >>> print branch
    None


Setting official branches
-------------------------

We can even set a branch for the series. First we need to *make* a branch
though.

    >>> login(ANONYMOUS)
    >>> ubuntu = getUtility(IDistributionSet).getByName('ubuntu')
    >>> hoary = getUtility(IDistroSeriesSet).queryByName(ubuntu, 'hoary')
    >>> evolution_package = hoary.getSourcePackage('evolution')
    >>> owner = factory.makePerson(name='devo')
    >>> branch = factory.makePackageBranch(
    ...     sourcepackage=evolution_package, owner=owner, name='branch')
    >>> print branch.unique_name
    ~devo/ubuntu/hoary/evolution/branch
    >>> branch_url = '/' + branch.unique_name
    >>> logout()

And actually, when I said "we", I wasn't talking about you. I was talking
about members of the ubuntu-branches celebrity team.

    >>> login('admin@canonical.com')
    >>> person = factory.makePerson()
    >>> ubuntu_branches = getUtility(ILaunchpadCelebrities).ubuntu_branches
    >>> ignored = ubuntu_branches.addMember(person, ubuntu_branches.teamowner)
    >>> logout()

Then we set the branch on the evolution hoary package:

    >>> webservice = webservice_for_person(
    ...     person, permission=OAuthPermission.WRITE_PRIVATE)
    >>> branch = webservice.get(branch_url).jsonBody()
    >>> response = webservice.named_post(
    ...     evolution['self_link'], 'setBranch', pocket='Release',
    ...     branch=branch['self_link'])
    >>> print response.jsonBody()
    None

I guess this means that if we get the branch for the RELEASE pocket again,
we'll get the new branch.

    >>> branch = webservice.named_get(evolution['self_link'], 'getBranch',
    ...     pocket='Release').jsonBody()
    >>> print branch['unique_name']
    ~devo/ubuntu/hoary/evolution/branch

    >>> linked_branches = webservice.named_get(
    ...     evolution['self_link'], 'linkedBranches').jsonBody()
    >>> print linked_branches.keys()
    [u'RELEASE']
    >>> branch = linked_branches[u'RELEASE']
    >>> print branch['unique_name']
    ~devo/ubuntu/hoary/evolution/branch

Of course, we're also allowed to change our minds. If we set the branch for
the RELEASE pocket to 'null' (i.e. the JSON for Python' None), then there is
no longer an official branch for that pocket.

    >>> response = webservice.named_post(
    ...     evolution['self_link'], 'setBranch', pocket='Release',
    ...     branch='null')
    >>> print response.jsonBody()
    None
    >>> branch = webservice.named_get(evolution['self_link'], 'getBranch',
    ...     pocket='Release').jsonBody()
    >>> print branch
    None
