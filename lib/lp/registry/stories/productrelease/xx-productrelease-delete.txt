= Deleting product releases =

The main page of a product series includes a list of releases of that series.

    >>> user_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/firefox/trunk')
    >>> print extract_text(find_tag_by_id(
    ...     user_browser.contents, 'series-details'))
    The "trunk" series represents the primary line of development...
    >>> print extract_text(find_tag_by_id(
    ...     user_browser.contents, 'series_trunk'))
    Version     Codename    Date Released
    0.9.2...
    0.9.1...
    0.9...


A User with launchpad.Edit rights for a release can see the delete link and
access the delete page. A user without the necessary rights won't see the
link and cannot access the +delete page.

    >>> user_browser.getLink('0.9.2').click()
    >>> print user_browser.title
    Mozilla Firefox 0.9.2 "One (secure) Tree Hill"
    >>> user_browser.getLink(url='/firefox/trunk/0.9.2/+delete')
    Traceback (most recent call last):

    LinkNotFoundError
    >>> user_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/firefox/trunk/0.9.2/+delete')

    >>> salgados_browser = setupBrowser(auth='Basic salgado@ubuntu.com:zeca')
    >>> salgados_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/firefox/trunk/0.9.2')
    >>> salgados_browser.getLink('Delete this release').click()
    >>> print salgados_browser.title

they will be deleted too.
