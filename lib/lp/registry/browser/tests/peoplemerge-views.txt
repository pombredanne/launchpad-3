People Merge Pages
==================

There are a number of views for merging people and teams.

Team Merges
-----------

Create a member of the registry team that is not a member of the admins
team.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces.launchpad import (
    ...     ILaunchpadCelebrities)
    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.person import IPersonSet
    >>> registry_experts = getUtility(ILaunchpadCelebrities).registry_experts
    >>> person_set = getUtility(IPersonSet)
    >>> registry_expert= factory.makeRegistryExpert()
    >>> login_person(registry_expert)

A team (name21) can be merged into another (ubuntu-team).

    >>> print person_set.getByName('name21').displayname
    Hoary Gnome Team
    >>> print person_set.getByName('ubuntu-team').displayname
    Ubuntu Team

    >>> form = {'field.dupe_person': 'name21',
    ...         'field.target_person': 'ubuntu-team',
    ...         'field.actions.merge': 'Merge'}
    >>> view = create_initialized_view(
    ...     person_set, '+adminteammerge', form=form)
    >>> len(view.errors)
    0

The old team is now renamed but the target team remains.

    >>> print person_set.getByName('name21')
    None
    >>> print person_set.getByName('ubuntu-team').displayname
    Ubuntu Team

Teams which have superteams cannot be merged into other teams. This
restriction was added as a fix to https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/290681.

    >>> parent_team = factory.makeTeam()
    >>> child_team = factory.makeTeam(name='child-team')
    >>> random_team = factory.makeTeam()
    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')
    >>> ignored = parent_team.addMember(
    ...     child_team, reviewer=parent_team.teamowner, force_team_add=True)
    >>> form = {'field.dupe_person': child_team.name,
    ...         'field.target_person': random_team.name,
    ...         'field.actions.deactivate_members_and_merge': 'Merge'}
    >>> view = create_initialized_view(
    ...     person_set, '+adminteammerge', form=form)
    >>> view.errors
    [u"child-team has super teams, so it can't be merged."]

Attempting to merge a non-existent team results in an error.

    >>> form = {'field.dupe_person': 'not-a-real-team',
    ...         'field.target_person': 'another-fake-team',
    ...         'field.actions.merge': 'Merge'}
    >>> view = create_initialized_view(
    ...     person_set, '+adminteammerge', form=form)
    >>> len(view.errors)
    2
    >>> for error in view.errors:
    ...     print error[0]
    Invalid value
    Invalid value


People merge
------------

For regular users to merge Launchpad profiles, we require that they confirm
ownership of the merged profile's email addresses, so it's not possible for
them to merge a profile which has no email address.

    >>> admin = person_set.getByName('name16')
    >>> login_person(registry_expert)

    # First we need to forge a person without a single email address.
    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.person import PersonCreationRationale
    >>> person = person_set.createPersonWithoutEmail(
    ...     'email-less-person', PersonCreationRationale.UNKNOWN)
    >>> transaction.commit()

    >>> form = {'field.dupe_person': person.name,
    ...        'field.actions.continue': 'Continue'}
    >>> view = create_initialized_view(
    ...     person_set, '+requestmerge', form=form)
    >>> len(view.errors)
    1

    # XXX Salgado, 2009-07-08, bug=396410: There should be a meaningful
    # error message here instead of this one.
    >>> print view.getFieldError('dupe_person')
    Constraint not satisfied

Admins, on the other hand, are allowed to merge people without a single email
address.

    >>> form = {'field.dupe_person': person.name,
    ...         'field.target_person': 'name16',
    ...         'field.actions.merge': 'Merge'}
    >>> view = create_initialized_view(
    ...     person_set, '+adminpeoplemerge', form=form)
    >>> view.errors
    []
    >>> print view.request.response.getHeader('location')
    http://launchpad.dev/~name16


Delete team
-----------

Users with launchpad.Moderate such as team admins and registry experts
can delete teams.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.webapp.authorization import check_permission

    >>> team_owner = factory.makePerson()
    >>> team_member = factory.makePerson()
    >>> deletable_team = factory.makeTeam(owner=team_owner, name='deletable')
    >>> login_person(team_owner)
    >>> ignore = deletable_team.addMember(team_member, reviewer=team_owner)
    >>> view = create_initialized_view(deletable_team, '+delete')

    >>> login_person(team_member)
    >>> check_permission('launchpad.Moderate', view)
    False

    >>> login_person(registry_expert)
    >>> check_permission('launchpad.Moderate', view)
    True

    >>> login_person(team_owner)
    >>> check_permission('launchpad.Moderate', view)
    True

The view provides a label, page_title, and cancel url to present the page.

    >>> print view.label
    Delete Deletable

    >>> print view.page_title
    Delete

    >>> print view.cancel_url
    http://launchpad.dev/~deletable

The view uses the same form fields as the team merge view, but it does not
render them because their values are preset. Only the action is rendered,
and it is only rendered if canDelete() returns True.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.testing.pages import find_tag_by_id

    >>> view = create_initialized_view(
    ...     deletable_team, '+delete', principal=team_owner)
    >>> view.field_names
    ['dupe_person', 'target_person']

    >>> view.default_values
    {'field.target_person': u'registry', 'field.dupe_person': u'deletable'}

    >>> content = find_tag_by_id(view.render(), 'maincontent')
    >>> print find_tag_by_id(content, 'field.dupe_person')
    None

    >>> print find_tag_by_id(content, 'field.target_person')
    None

    >>> print find_tag_by_id(content, 'field.actions.delete')['value']
    Delete

    >>> view.canDelete(data={})
    True

The page explains how many users will be removed from the team before it is
deleted.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.testing.pages import extract_text

    >>> print extract_text(content)
    Delete Deletable
    Deleting a team is permanent. It cannot be undone.
    Deletable has 2 active members who will be removed before it is deleted...

The user is redirected to /people when a team is deleted.

    >>> form = {'field.actions.delete': 'Delete'}
    >>> view = create_initialized_view(deletable_team, '+delete', form=form)
    >>> view.errors
    []

    >>> for notification in view.request.response.notifications:
    ...     print notification.message
    Team deleted.

    >>> print view.next_url
    http://launchpad.dev/people

    >>> print person_set.getByName('deletable')
    None

The delete team view cannot be hacked to delete another team, or change
the team that the merge operation is performed with.

    >>> deletable_team = factory.makeTeam(owner=team_owner, name='deletable')
    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> form = {
    ...     'field.target_person': 'rosetta-admins',
    ...     'field.dupe_person': 'landscape-developers',
    ...     'field.actions.delete': 'Delete'}
    >>> view = create_initialized_view(deletable_team, '+delete', form=form)
    >>> for error in view.errors:
    ...     print error
    Unable to process submitted data.

    >>> view.request.response.notifications
    []

    >>> print deletable_team.name
    deletable

A team with a mailing list cannot be deleted.

    >>> team, mailing_list = factory.makeTeamAndMailingList(
    ...     'not-deletable', 'rock')
    >>> login_person(team.teamowner)
    >>> view = create_initialized_view(
    ...     team, '+delete', principal=team.teamowner)
    >>> view.canDelete(data={})
    False

    >>> view.has_mailing_list
    True

    >>> content = find_tag_by_id(view.render(), 'maincontent')
    >>> print extract_text(content)
    Delete Not Deletable
    Deleting a team is permanent. It cannot be undone.
    This team cannot be deleted until its mailing list is first deactivated,
    then purged after the deactivation is confirmed...

    >>> print find_tag_by_id(content, 'field.actions.delete')
    None

Private teams can be deleted by admins.

    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.person import PersonVisibility

    >>> login('commercial-member@canonical.com')
    >>> private_team = factory.makeTeam(
    ...     name='secret', visibility=PersonVisibility.PRIVATE)
    >>> login('admin@canonical.com')
    >>> form = {'field.actions.delete': 'Delete'}
    >>> view = create_initialized_view(private_team, '+delete', form=form)
    >>> view.errors
    []
    >>> for notification in view.request.response.notifications:
    ...     print notification.message
    Team deleted.
