= Product Pages =

The browser module for product has many view classes that should be
tested in this pages test.  As it is this test is pretty sparse.


== Product View ==

The page at /product_name includes overview information about the product.


=== Effective Driver ===

The `effective_driver` property on the view shows the product driver,
if one exists.  If the product does not have a driver, then the driver
for the project is returned.  If the product has no project or the
project has no driver then None is returned.

    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.product import IProductSet
    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.project import IProjectSet
    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.person import IPersonSet
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests import ANONYMOUS
    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')
    >>> mozilla = getUtility(IProjectSet).getByName('mozilla')
    >>> firefox = getUtility(IProductSet).getByName('firefox')
    >>> cprov = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('cprov')
    >>> sabdfl = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('sabdfl')

Neither Mozilla nor Firefox has a driver set.

    >>> print mozilla.driver
    None
    >>> print firefox.driver
    None

Thus the effective driver for Firefox is None.
    >>> view = create_initialized_view(firefox, name='+index')
    >>> print view.effective_driver
    None

Setting the driver for the Mozilla project trickles down to Firefox.

    >>> mozilla.driver = sabdfl

But since the effective_driver is a cached property it will not show
up on this view instance.

    >>> print view.effective_driver
    None

Creating a new view shows the new driver.

    >>> view = create_initialized_view(firefox, name='+index')
    >>> print view.effective_driver.name
    sabdfl

Setting the driver for Firefox shows that it is used for the product,
after a new view is obtained.

    >>> firefox.driver = cprov
    >>> print view.effective_driver.name
    sabdfl
    >>> view = create_initialized_view(firefox, name='+index')
    >>> print view.effective_driver.name
    cprov

=== Displaying Commercial Subscription Information ===

Only project maintainers, Launchpad administrators, and Launchpad
Commercial members are to see commercial subscription information on
the product overview page.

For product maintainers the property is true.  Sample Person
(test@canonical.com) is the owner of the Firefox product.

    >>> login('test@canonical.com')
    >>> view = create_initialized_view(firefox, name='+index')
    >>> print view.show_commercial_subscription_info
    True

For Launchpad admins the property is true.

    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')
    >>> view = create_initialized_view(firefox, name='+index')
    >>> print view.show_commercial_subscription_info
    True

For Launchpad commercial members th property is true.

    >>> login('commercial-member@canonical.com')
    >>> view = create_initialized_view(firefox, name='+index')
    >>> print view.show_commercial_subscription_info
    True

But for a no-privileges user the property is false.

    >>> login('no-priv@canonical.com')
    >>> view = create_initialized_view(firefox, name='+index')
    >>> print view.show_commercial_subscription_info
    False

And for an anonymous user it is false.

    >>> login(ANONYMOUS)
    >>> view = create_initialized_view(firefox, name='+index')
    >>> print view.show_commercial_subscription_info
    False
