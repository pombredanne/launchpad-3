Pillar views
============

Pillar views are used to display IPillar objects link distributions and
products in a consistent fashion.

The +get-involved presentation creates a portlet of links to encourage
project involvement. Only links to official applications are rendered.


    >>> distribution = factory.makeDistribution(name='umbra')
    >>> login_person(distribution.owner)
    >>> view = create_view(
    ...     distribution, '+get-involved', principal=distribution.owner)

The has_involvement property is used to determine if the portlet should
be rendered. The newly created pillar does not use any launchpad applications.

    >>> view.has_involvement
    False

    >>> print view.render()
    <BLANKLINE>

Pillars that do use launchpad applications have an involvement menu.

    >>> distribution.official_answers = True
    >>> distribution.official_malone = True
    >>> view = create_view(
    ...     distribution, '+get-involved', principal=distribution.owner)
    >>> view.has_involvement
    True

    >>> view.official_malone
    True
    >>> view.official_answers
    True
    >>> view.official_rosetta
    False
    >>> view.official_blueprints
    False
    >>> view.official_codehosting
    False

The view provides a list of enabled links that is rendered by the template.

    >>> for link in view.enabled_links:
    ...     print link.name
    report_bug ask_question

    >>> print view.render()
    <div id="involvement" class="portlet involvement">
      <h2>Get Involved</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="..." class="...bugs">Report a bug</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="..." class="...answers">Ask a question</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

Products are are supported.

    >>> product = factory.makeProduct(name='bread')
    >>> login_person(product.owner)
    >>> product.official_blueprints = True
    >>> view = create_view(product, '+get-involved')
    >>> view.official_blueprints
    True

Project are supported too, but they only display the applications used by
their products.

    >>> project_group = factory.makeProject(name='box', owner=product.owner)
    >>> product.project = project_group

    >>> view = create_view(project_group, '+get-involved')
    >>> view.official_blueprints
    True

Projects cannot make links to register a branch, so official_code is always
false.

    >>> product.official_codehosting = True
    >>> view = create_view(product, '+get-involved')
    >>> view.official_codehosting
    True

    >>> view = create_view(project_group, '+get-involved')
    >>> view.official_codehosting
    False

DistroSeries can use this view. The distribution is used to set the links.

    >>> series = factory.makeDistroRelease(distribution=distribution)
    >>> view = create_view(series, '+get-involved')
    >>> for link in view.enabled_links:
    ...     print link.name
    report_bug

ProductSeries can use this view. The product is used to set the links,
but the answers link will be disbaled.

    >>> series = factory.makeProductSeries(product=product)
    >>> product.official_answers = True
    >>> view = create_view(series, '+get-involved')
    >>> for link in view.enabled_links:
    ...     print link.name
    submit_code register_blueprint

DistributionSourcePackages can use this view. The distribution is used to
set the links.  Despite the fact that the distribution uses blueprints,
and translations those links are not enabled for DistributionSourcePackages.

    >>> login_person(distribution.owner)
    >>> distribution.official_blueprints = True
    >>> distribution.official_rosetta = True
    >>> package = factory.makeDistributionSourcePackage(
    ...     distribution=distribution)
    >>> view = create_view(package, '+get-involved')
    >>> for link in view.enabled_links:
    ...     print link.name
    report_bug ask_question


Involvement links
-----------------

The pillar involvement view uses the InvolvedMenu when rendering links:

    >>> from operator import attrgetter
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.webapp.tales import MenuAPI

    >>> view = create_view(product, '+get-involved')
    >>> menuapi = MenuAPI(view)
    >>> for link in sorted(
    ...     menuapi.navigation.values(), key=attrgetter('sort_key')):
    ...     print link.url
