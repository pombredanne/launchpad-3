Project add views
=================

New projects are registered in Launchpad using a two step multi-view widget.

    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.product import IProductSet
    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')
    >>> product_set = getUtility(IProductSet)

    >>> view = create_initialized_view(product_set, name='+new')
    >>> view.first_step
    <class 'lp.registry.browser.product.ProjectAddStepOne'>

The first step requires all of name, summary, displayname to be given.  These
are forwarded in the form data to the second step.  The title is also
forwarded, but is only required by the Zope machinery, not the view.

    >>> from lp.registry.browser.product import ProjectAddStepOne
    >>> form = {
    ...     'field.actions.continue': 'Continue',
    ...     'field.__visited_steps__': ProjectAddStepOne.step_name,
    ...     'field.displayname': '',
    ...     'field.name': '',
    ...     'field.summary': '',
    ... }

    >>> view = create_initialized_view(product_set, name='+new', form=form)
    >>> for error in view.view.errors:
    ...     print error
    ('displayname', 'Name', RequiredMissing())
    ('name', 'URL', RequiredMissing())
    ('summary', u'Summary', RequiredMissing())

    >>> form['field.displayname'] = 'Snowdog'
    >>> form['field.name'] = 'snowdog'
    >>> form['field.summary'] = 'By-tor and the Snowdog'
    >>> view = create_initialized_view(product_set, name='+new', form=form)

Each step in the process has a label, a description, and a search results
count.  The first step has no search results.

    # Because of the way the multistep view works, we need to test the
    # steps individually.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.webapp.servers import LaunchpadTestRequest

    >>> form['field.__visited_steps__'] = ProjectAddStepOne.step_name
    >>> request = LaunchpadTestRequest(form=form, method='POST')
    >>> view = ProjectAddStepOne(product_set, request)
    >>> view.initialize()

    >>> print view.label
    Register a project in Launchpad
    >>> print view.step_description
    Project basics
    >>> view.search_results_count
    0

The second step has the same attributes, but it provides a little more
information in the label.

    >>> from lp.registry.browser.product import ProjectAddStepTwo
    >>> form = {
    ...     'field.actions.continue': 'Continue',
    ...     'field.__visited_steps__': ProjectAddStepTwo.step_name,
    ...     'field.displayname': 'Snowdog',
    ...     'field.name': 'snowdog',
    ...     'field.title': 'The Snowdog',
    ...     'field.summary': 'By-tor and the Snowdog',
    ...     }

    >>> request = LaunchpadTestRequest(form=form, method='POST')
    >>> view = ProjectAddStepTwo(product_set, request)
    >>> view.initialize()

    >>> print view.label
    Register Snowdog (snowdog) in Launchpad
    >>> print view.step_description
    Registration details
    >>> view.search_results_count
    0

The second step also has a iterator over all the search results, of which
there are currently none.

    >>> list(view.search_results)
    []

The prospective project's name, displayname and summary are used to search
existing projects for possible matches.  By tweaking the project summary, we
can see that there are search results available.

    >>> form['field.summary'] = 'My Snowdog ate your Firefox'

    >>> request = LaunchpadTestRequest(form=form, method='POST')
    >>> view = ProjectAddStepTwo(product_set, request)
    >>> view.initialize()

    >>> print view.label
    Register Snowdog (snowdog) in Launchpad

Because there are search results, the description used on the page is
different.

    >>> print view.step_description
    Check for duplicate projects

The search results are displayed on the page.

    >>> view.search_results_count
    2
    >>> for project in view.search_results:
    ...     print project.name
    firefox
    mozilla

The project's license has not yet been selected, so posting this form will
result in an error, since the license is required.

    >>> form.update({
    ...     'field.__visited_steps__': '%s|%s' % (
    ...         ProjectAddStepOne.step_name, ProjectAddStepTwo.step_name),
    ...     'field.actions.continue': 'Continue',
    ...     })

    >>> request = LaunchpadTestRequest(form=form, method='POST')
    >>> view = ProjectAddStepTwo(product_set, request)
    >>> view.initialize()
    >>> for error in view.errors:
    ...     print error
    You must select at least one license.  If you select Other/Proprietary
    or Other/OpenSource you must include a description of the license.

When an open source license is selected, the project is created.

    # The form keys have the 'field.' prefix here because the form data will
    # be processed.
    >>> form = {
    ...     'field.displayname': 'Snowdog',
    ...     'field.name': 'snowdog',
    ...     'field.title': 'The Snowdog',
    ...     'field.summary': 'By-tor and the Snowdog',
    ...     'field.licenses': ['PYTHON'],
    ...     'field.license_info': '',
    ...     'field.__visited_steps__': '%s|%s' % (
    ...         ProjectAddStepOne.step_name, ProjectAddStepTwo.step_name),
    ...     'field.actions.continue': 'Continue',
    ...     }
    >>> request = LaunchpadTestRequest(form=form, method='POST')
    >>> view = ProjectAddStepTwo(product_set, request)
    >>> view.initialize()
    >>> view.errors
    []

    >>> print product_set.getByName('snowdog').displayname
    Snowdog


Feedback notification
---------------------

When projects are created with the Other/Proprietary, Other/Open Source or
I Don't Know license, a message is sent to the user explaining the licensing
rules.

    >>> form = {
    ...     'field.displayname': 'Badger',
    ...     'field.name': 'badger',
    ...     'field.title': 'The Badger',
    ...     'field.summary': "There's the Badger!",
    ...     'field.licenses': ['OTHER_PROPRIETARY'],
    ...     'field.license_info': '',
    ...     'field.__visited_steps__': '%s|%s' % (
    ...         ProjectAddStepOne.step_name, ProjectAddStepTwo.step_name),
    ...     'field.actions.continue': 'Continue',
    ...     }
    >>> request = LaunchpadTestRequest(form=form, method='POST')
    >>> view = ProjectAddStepTwo(product_set, request)
    >>> view.initialize()

However, when a proprietary license is selected, a description is required.

    >>> for error in view.errors:
    ...     print error
    A description of the "Other/Proprietary" license you checked is required.

    >>> form['field.license_info'] = 'The Badger(tm) License'
    >>> request = LaunchpadTestRequest(form=form, method='POST')
    >>> view = ProjectAddStepTwo(product_set, request)
    >>> view.initialize()
    >>> view.errors
    []

    >>> print product_set.getByName('badger').displayname
    Badger

    >>> transaction.commit()

    Subject: License information for badger in Launchpad
    Hello name16,
    <BLANKLINE>
    You recently registered the project 'badger' in Launchpad
    with this licensing:
    <BLANKLINE>
        Other/Proprietary.
    <BLANKLINE>
    Launchpad is a collaboration site that is free to use for projects
    with an approved open source license.  When you registered your
    project the list of licenses presented are the ones we automatically
    recognize.
    <BLANKLINE>
    Other licenses must follow the guidelines we list on the following
    page in order to be approved:
    https://help.launchpad.net/Legal/ProjectLicensing
    <BLANKLINE>
    Further information is on our FAQ "Can closed-source or proprietary
    projects use Launchpad?" which can be found at:
    https://answers.launchpad.net/launchpad/+faq/208
    <BLANKLINE>
    If your project's licensing does not meet the guidelines we will
    consider it "Proprietary" and mark it as such in Launchpad.
    <BLANKLINE>
    Proprietary projects can use Launchpad by purchasing a commercial-use
    subscription which costs US$250/year/project.  Please follow the
    instructions presented on your project overview page to purchase a
    subscription voucher.  Feel free to contact me if you have any
    questions.
    <BLANKLINE>
    Sometimes new projects are licensed as 'Other/Open Source' because the
    licensing decisions have not yet been made.  If that is your situation
    we urge you to update the licensing in Launchpad as soon as you make
    that choice.
    <BLANKLINE>
    If the license for your project needs to be corrected you can do so by
    following the 'Change Details' link on your project's overview page.
    <BLANKLINE>
    Thanks,
    <BLANKLINE>
    The Launchpad team.

Duplicate projects
------------------

A project that already exists cannot be registered again.  The only field
that's checked for duplicates is the 'name' field.

    >>> form = {
    ...     'field.displayname': 'Cougar',
    ...     'field.name': 'badger',
    ...     'field.title': 'The Cougar',
    ...     'field.summary': "There's the Cougar!",
    ...     'field.__visited_steps__': ProjectAddStepOne.step_name,
    ...     'field.actions.continue': 'Continue',
    ...     }
    >>> request = LaunchpadTestRequest(form=form, method='POST')
    >>> view = ProjectAddStepOne(product_set, request)
    >>> view.initialize()

    >>> for error in view.errors:
    ...     print error
    ('name', 'URL',
     LaunchpadValidationError(u'badger is already used by another project'))
