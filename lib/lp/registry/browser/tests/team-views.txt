Team pages
==========

Home page
---------

    >>> from zope.component import getMultiAdapter
    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.person import IPersonSet
    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.teammembership import ITeamMembershipSet
    >>> person_set = getUtility(IPersonSet)

On a team home page, we show up to the latest five members who were approved
as well as the up to five latest members who proposed themselves.

    >>> ubuntu_team = person_set.getByName('name18')
    >>> team_home = create_initialized_view(ubuntu_team, '+index')
    >>> membershipset = getUtility(ITeamMembershipSet)
    >>> for member in team_home.recently_approved_members:
    ...     membership = membershipset.getByPersonAndTeam(member, ubuntu_team)
    ...     print "%s: %s" % (member.name, membership.status.title)
    name20: Approved
    spiv: Approved
    limi: Approved

    >>> for member in team_home.recently_proposed_members:
    ...     membership = membershipset.getByPersonAndTeam(member, ubuntu_team)
    ...     print "%s: %s" % (member.name, membership.status.title)

If new members are added/proposed, they'll show up at the top of the lists.

    >>> sample_person = person_set.getByName('name12')
    >>> login_person(sample_person)
    >>> sample_person.join(ubuntu_team)
    >>> salgado = person_set.getByName('salgado')
    >>> mark = person_set.getByName('mark')
    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')
    >>> ignored = ubuntu_team.addMember(salgado, reviewer=mark)

    >>> team_home = create_initialized_view(ubuntu_team, '+index')
    >>> for member in team_home.recently_approved_members:
    ...     membership = membershipset.getByPersonAndTeam(member, ubuntu_team)
    ...     print "%s: %s" % (member.name, membership.status.title)
    salgado: Approved
    name20: Approved
    spiv: Approved
    limi: Approved

    >>> for member in team_home.recently_proposed_members:
    ...     membership = membershipset.getByPersonAndTeam(member, ubuntu_team)
    ...     print "%s: %s" % (member.name, membership.status.title)
    name12: Proposed

Posting malformed data to the team home page raises an error.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.webapp.servers import LaunchpadTestRequest
    >>> broken_request = LaunchpadTestRequest(
    ...     form={})
    >>> broken_request.method = 'POST'
    >>> team_home = getMultiAdapter(
    ...     (ubuntu_team, broken_request), name='+index')
    >>> team_home.initialize()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    UnexpectedFormData: The mailing list form did not receive the expected
    form fields.


+map-portlet
------------

The team profile page contain the location portlet that shows a map.

    >>> team_view = create_initialized_view(ubuntu_team, '+index')
    >>> team_view.has_visible_location
    False

After a member has set his location, the map will be rendered.

    >>> login_person(sample_person)
    >>> sample_person.setLocation(
    ...     38.81, 77.1, 'America/New_York', sample_person)

    >>> team_view = create_initialized_view(ubuntu_team, '+index')
    >>> team_view.has_visible_location
    True

The small_maps key in the launchpad_views cookie can be set by the viewing
user to 'false' to indicate that small maps are not wanted.

    >>> cookie = 'launchpad_views=small_maps=false'
    >>> team_view = create_initialized_view(
    ...     ubuntu_team, '+index', cookie=cookie)

+map
----

A team's +map page will show a map with markers on the location of all
members of that team.  That page also lists the local times of members.

    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')
    >>> context = factory.makeTeam(salgado)
    >>> context.mapped_participants_count
    0
    >>> view = create_initialized_view(context, '+map')
    >>> view.times
    []


Once a member is mapped, the map will be rendered. The view provides a cached
property to access the mapped participants. The views number of times is
incremented for each timezone the members reside in.

    >>> london_member = factory.makePerson(
    ...     latitude=51.49, longitude=-0.13, time_zone='Europe/London')
    >>> ignored = context.addMember(london_member, mark)
    >>> context.mapped_participants_count
    1
    >>> view = create_initialized_view(context, '+map')
    >>> len(view.mapped_participants)
    1
    >>> len(view.times)
    1

    >>> brazil_member = factory.makePerson(
    ...     latitude=-23.60, longitude=-46.64, time_zone='America/Sao_Paulo')
    >>> ignored = context.addMember(brazil_member, mark)
    >>> context.mapped_participants_count
    2
    >>> view = create_initialized_view(context, '+map')
    >>> len(view.mapped_participants)
    2
    >>> len(view.times)
    2

If we had two members in London, though, we wouldn't list London's time
twice, for obvious reasons.

    >>> london_member2 = factory.makePerson(
    ...     latitude=51.49, longitude=-0.13, time_zone='Europe/London')
    >>> ignored = context.addMember(london_member2, mark)
    >>> context.mapped_participants_count
    3
    >>> view = create_initialized_view(context, '+map')
    >>> len(view.times)
    2

The number of persons returned by mapped_participants is governed by the
view's limit attribute. The default value is None, meaning there is no
limit.  This view is used for displaying the full map.

    >>> print view.limit
    None
    >>> len(view.mapped_participants)
    3

A portlet for the map also exists which is used for displaying the map
inside the person or team page.  It has the number of participants limited.

    >>> view = create_initialized_view(context, '+portlet-map')
    >>> view.limit
    24

    # Hack the limit to demonstrate that it controls mapped_participants.
    >>> view.limit = 1
    >>> len(view.mapped_participants)
    1

The view provides the count of mapped and unmapped members. The counts
are cached to improve performance.

    >>> view = create_initialized_view(context, '+map')
    >>> view.mapped_participants_count
    3
    >>> view.unmapped_participants_count
    1

The template can ask if the team has mapped members, so that it does not
need to work with counts or the list of members.

    >>> view.has_mapped_participants
    True

The cached bounds of the mapped members of the team can be used to define
the scale of a map.

    >>> bounds = view.bounds
    >>> for key in sorted(bounds):
    ...     print "%s: %s" % (key, bounds[key])
    center_lat: 13...
    center_lng: -23...
    max_lat: 51...
    max_lng: -0...
    min_lat: -23...
    min_lng: -46...


Contacting the team
-------------------

Logged in users can contact any other Launchpad user through a 'Contact this
user' feature (see person-pages.txt).  Similarly, a logged in user can contact
a team through a 'Contact this team' link.

The team's overview page tells us that we're contacting a team instead of a
user. The title of the link states that the team owner will be contacted
because bart is not a member of the team.

    >>> guadamen = person_set.getByName('guadamen')
    >>> bart = factory.makePerson(email='bart@example.com', name='bart')
    >>> login_person(bart)

    >>> view = create_initialized_view(guadamen, '+index')
    >>> print view.contact_link_title
    Send an email to this team's owner through Launchpad
    >>> print view.specific_contact_text
    Contact this team's owner


Mugshots
--------

The mugshots for all members of a team can be seen on the +mugshots
page.  The display of mugshots is batched.

    >>> ubuntu = person_set.getByName('ubuntu-team')
    >>> view = create_initialized_view(ubuntu, '+mugshots')
    >>> batch = view.members.currentBatch()
    >>> print len(list(ubuntu.allmembers))
    10
    >>> print view.batch_size
    8
    >>> print len(list(batch))
    8
    >>> from zope.security.proxy import removeSecurityProxy
    >>> for person in list(batch):
    ...     print removeSecurityProxy(person)
    <Person at ... limi (Alexander Limi)>
    <Person at ... cprov (Celso Providelo)>
    <Person at ... kamion (Colin Watson)>
    <Person at ... kinnison (Daniel Silverstone)>
    <Person at ... edgar (Edgar Bursic)>
    <Person at ... name16 (Foo Bar)>
    <Person at ... jdub (Jeff Waugh)>
    <Person at ... mark (Mark Shuttleworth)>


Privacy and visibility
----------------------

Team visibility is used on the page to indicate privacy.  GuadaMen is a public
team.

    >>> view = create_initialized_view(guadamen, '+index')
    >>> print view.visibility_info
    Public team
    >>> print view.visibility_portlet_class
    portlet

Private teams are indicated as private.

    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.person import PersonVisibility
    >>> login('admin@canonical.com')
    >>> private_team = factory.makeTeam(
    ...     owner=sample_person,
    ...     name='private-team', displayname='Private Team',
    ...     visibility=PersonVisibility.PRIVATE)

    >>> view = create_initialized_view(private_team, '+index')
    >>> print view.visibility_info
    Private team
    >>> print view.visibility_portlet_class
    portlet private

+add-my-teams
-------------

This page lists the teams that you administer and can add as a member
to the current team. Private teams cannot be added as members to another
team.

    >>> login_person(sample_person)
    >>> view = create_initialized_view(guadamen, '+add-my-teams')
    >>> for candidate in view.candidate_teams:
    ...     print candidate.name, candidate.visibility.title
    landscape-developers Public
    launchpad-users Public
