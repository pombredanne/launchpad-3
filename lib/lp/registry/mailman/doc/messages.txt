Launchpad uses a custom set of message templates that it installs
in mailman/templates/site. The installation conforms to the standard
way of defining templates that apply to all lists managed by the
instance of mailman. The site template directory contains only the
templates that are different from the default mailman templates.

The postheld message text does not include a link to cancel the posting,
which launchpad does not support.

    >>> from Mailman import Utils

    >>> postheld_dict = {
    ...     'listname': 'fake-list',
    ...     'hostname': 'lists.launchpad.net',
    ...     'reason': 'The attachment is too large to post to the list.',
    ...     'sender': 'test@canonical.com',
    ...     'subject' : "testing post held for large attachment",
    ...     'admindb_url': 'http://lists.launchpad.net/fake/admin',
    ...     }
    >>> text, filename = Utils.findtext('postheld.txt', dict=postheld_dict)
    >>> filename
    '.../lib/mailman/templates/site/en/postheld.txt'
    >>> print text
    Your mail to 'fake-list' with the subject
      testing post held for large attachment
    Is being held until the list moderator can review it for approval.
    ...
    Either the message will get posted to the list, or you will receive
    notification of the moderator's decision.
