========================
Commercial Subscriptions
========================

The CommercialSubscription class is used to track whether a project,
which does not qualify for free hosting, has an unexpired subscription.

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.webapp.testing import verifyObject
    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.commercialsubscription import (
    ...     ICommercialSubscription)
    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.product import IProductSet
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.ftests import login, ANONYMOUS
    >>> login('no-priv@canonical.com')

An open source project should not have a commercial subscription,
indicated by 'None'.

    >>> product_set = getUtility(IProductSet)
    >>> bzr = product_set.getByName('bzr')
    >>> print bzr.commercial_subscription
    None

Redeem a voucher and check that the commercial_subscription
attribute is correct.

    >>> owner = bzr.owner
    >>> owner.isTeam()
    False
    >>> bzr.redeemSubscriptionVoucher('asdf123', owner, owner, 12, 'notes')
    >>> verifyObject(ICommercialSubscription, bzr.commercial_subscription)
    True
    >>> print bzr.commercial_subscription.product.name
    bzr
    >>> print bzr.commercial_subscription.sales_system_id
    asdf123

Commercial subscriptions have zope.Public permissions for reading.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.webapp.authorization import check_permission
    >>> login(ANONYMOUS)
    >>> check_permission('zope.Public', bzr.commercial_subscription)
    True
    >>> print bzr.commercial_subscription.product.name
    bzr

For modification, launchpad.Commerical is required.  Anonymous users,
regular users, and the project owner all are denied.

    >>> check_permission('launchpad.Commercial', bzr.commercial_subscription)
    False

    >>> login('no-priv@canonical.com')
    >>> check_permission('launchpad.Commercial', bzr.commercial_subscription)
    False

    >>> login_person(owner)
    >>> check_permission('launchpad.Commercial', bzr.commercial_subscription)
    False

A member of the commercial admins team does have modification privileges.

    >>> from lp.app.interfaces.launchpad import ILaunchpadCelebrities
    >>> celebs = getUtility(ILaunchpadCelebrities)
    >>> commercial_admin = celebs.commercial_admin
    >>> login('commercial-member@canonical.com')
    >>> commercial_member = getUtility(ILaunchBag).user
    >>> commercial_member.inTeam(commercial_admin)
    True
    >>> check_permission('launchpad.Commercial', bzr.commercial_subscription)
    True


The expiration date can be extended by redeeming another voucher.  In
real life this would be done nearer to the expiration date.  For
testing consistency, let's force the start and expiry dates to a known
date and use a known time as the current time.

    >>> from zope.security.proxy import removeSecurityProxy
    >>> from datetime import date, datetime, timedelta
    >>> from pytz import UTC
    >>> login('no-priv@canonical.com')
    >>> now = datetime(2008, 1, 10, tzinfo=UTC)
    >>> subscription = removeSecurityProxy(bzr.commercial_subscription)
    >>> subscription.date_starts = datetime(2008,1,15,tzinfo=UTC)
    >>> subscription.date_expires = datetime(2009,1,15,tzinfo=UTC)
    >>> old_date_expires = bzr.commercial_subscription.date_expires
    >>> old_date_starts = bzr.commercial_subscription.date_starts
    >>> bzr.redeemSubscriptionVoucher('foo456', owner, owner, 12,
    ...     'notes', current_datetime=now)
    >>> print bzr.commercial_subscription.sales_system_id
    foo456

The start date should not have changed.

    >>> bzr.commercial_subscription.date_starts == old_date_starts
    True

The difference between the expiration dates is one year -- 365 days
for 2009.

    >>> expiry_diff = (bzr.commercial_subscription.date_expires -
    ...                old_date_expires)
    >>> expiry_diff == timedelta(365)
    True

A voucher can be redeemed for any number of months (as reported by the
Salesforce proxy).  Test for a 6 month subscription.

    >>> old_date_expires = bzr.commercial_subscription.date_expires
    >>> old_date_starts = bzr.commercial_subscription.date_starts
    >>> bzr.redeemSubscriptionVoucher('foo457', owner, owner, 6,
    ...     'notes', current_datetime=now)
    >>> print bzr.commercial_subscription.sales_system_id
    foo457

The start date did not change.

    >>> bzr.commercial_subscription.date_starts == old_date_starts
    True

The expiration date has been increased by six months, from Jan-15-2010
to Jul-15-2010.

    >>> expiry_diff = (bzr.commercial_subscription.date_expires -
    ...                old_date_expires)
    >>> expiry_diff == (datetime(2010,7,15) - datetime(2010,1,15))
    True

Time calculations are sometimes prone to wrapping problems.  Let's
ensure they wrap properly.

End the subscription in November and add one month.

    >>> subscription.date_expires = datetime(2009,11,15,tzinfo=UTC)
    >>> old_date_expires = bzr.commercial_subscription.date_expires
    >>> bzr.redeemSubscriptionVoucher('foo456', owner, owner, 1,
    ...     'notes', current_datetime=now)
    >>> print subscription.date_expires
    2009-12-15 ...

End the subscription in November and add two months.

    >>> subscription.date_expires = datetime(2009,11,15,tzinfo=UTC)
    >>> old_date_expires = bzr.commercial_subscription.date_expires
    >>> bzr.redeemSubscriptionVoucher('foo456', owner, owner, 2,
    ...     'notes', current_datetime=now)
    >>> print subscription.date_expires
    2010-01-15...

End the subscription in November and add 11 months.

    >>> subscription.date_expires = datetime(2009,11,15,tzinfo=UTC)
    >>> old_date_expires = bzr.commercial_subscription.date_expires
    >>> bzr.redeemSubscriptionVoucher('foo456', owner, owner, 11,
    ...     'notes', current_datetime=now)
    >>> print subscription.date_expires
    2010-10-15...

Ensure wrapping to the start of the next month works when the
expiration date would normally be an invalid day of the month.  A
subscription that expires on the October 31 and is extended by four
months will be calculated as the last day of February, not the
nonexistent February 31.

    >>> subscription.date_expires = datetime(2009,10,31,tzinfo=UTC)
    >>> old_date_expires = bzr.commercial_subscription.date_expires
    >>> bzr.redeemSubscriptionVoucher('foo456', owner, owner, 4,
    ...     'notes', current_datetime=now)
    >>> print subscription.date_expires
    2010-02-28...

And when the new date is in a leap year, the last day of February is
the 29th.

    >>> subscription.date_expires = datetime(2011,10,31,tzinfo=UTC)
    >>> old_date_expires = bzr.commercial_subscription.date_expires
    >>> bzr.redeemSubscriptionVoucher('foo456', owner, owner, 4,
    ...     'notes', current_datetime=now)
    >>> print subscription.date_expires
    2012-02-29...

Extending a subscription after it has expired sets the date started to
the current date.

    >>> subscription.date_starts = datetime(2008,1,15,tzinfo=UTC)
    >>> subscription.date_expires = datetime(2009,1,15,tzinfo=UTC)
    >>> now = datetime(2010, 1, 1, tzinfo=UTC)
    >>> bzr.redeemSubscriptionVoucher('foo456', owner, owner, 12,
    ...     'notes', current_datetime=now)
    >>> print subscription.date_expires
    2011-01-01...
    >>> print subscription.date_starts
    2010-01-01...

If the original subscription has not expired the start date is not affected.

    >>> subscription.date_starts = datetime(2008,1,15,tzinfo=UTC)
    >>> subscription.date_expires = datetime(2009,1,15,tzinfo=UTC)
    >>> now = datetime(2009, 1, 1, tzinfo=UTC)
    >>> bzr.redeemSubscriptionVoucher('foo456', owner, owner, 12,
    ...     'notes', current_datetime=now)
    >>> print subscription.date_expires
    2010-01-15...
    >>> print subscription.date_starts
    2008-01-15...

The commercial_subscription_is_due attribute is true if the license
does not qualify for free hosting and the commercial subscription
is inactive or about to expire.  The is_permitted attribute is
true if the project either has a qualifying license or has an active
commercial subscription. The qualifies_for_free_hosting attribute is
true, if automatically qualifying licenses are the only ones selected,
or if the license has been reviewed and been manually approved.

The commercial subscription is about to expire here.

    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')
    >>> subscription = removeSecurityProxy(bzr.commercial_subscription)
    >>> bzr.licenses
    ()
    >>> # The commercial subscription is due within 30 days of expiration.
    >>> subscription.date_expires = (
    ...     datetime.now(UTC) + timedelta(29))
    >>> bzr.qualifies_for_free_hosting
    False
    >>> bzr.commercial_subscription_is_due
    True
    >>> bzr.commercial_subscription.is_active
    True
    >>> bzr.is_permitted
    True

The subscription will not expire for more than 30 days so a new
subscription is not due yet.

    >>> subscription.date_expires = (
    ...     datetime.now(UTC) + timedelta(31))
    >>> bzr.commercial_subscription_is_due
    False

Make the subscription no longer active.

    >>> # Make the subscription last 0 seconds.
    >>> subscription.date_expires = subscription.date_starts
    >>> bzr.commercial_subscription.is_active
    False
    >>> bzr.commercial_subscription_is_due
    True
    >>> bzr.is_permitted
    False

The qualifies_for_free_hosting attribute is False
if the product has License.OTHER_PROPRIETARY.

    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.product import License
    >>> bzr.licenses = [License.OTHER_PROPRIETARY]
    >>> bzr.qualifies_for_free_hosting
    False
    >>> bzr.licenses = [License.GNU_GPL_V2]
    >>> bzr.qualifies_for_free_hosting
    True

The license_approved attribute is used to manually approve an
OTHER_OPEN_SOURCE license or a project with additional license info
as being "good enough" to use Launchpad. The license_approved property
can only be set on a product that does not have OTHER_PROPRIETARY
included as one of the licenses.

    >>> bzr.license_info = 'bar'
    >>> bzr.project_reviewed = True
    >>> bzr.license_approved = True

    >>> bzr.license_info
    u'bar'
    >>> bzr.project_reviewed
    True
    >>> bzr.license_approved
    True

Setting license_approved implies that the license has been reviewed,
so project_reviewed is set automatically.

    >>> bzr.project_reviewed = False
    >>> bzr.license_approved = True
    >>> bzr.project_reviewed
    True

Set the bzr license to Other/Open Source and Other/Proprietary.  It
may not be approved because Other/Proprietary requires a commercial
subscription.

    >>> bzr.licenses = [License.OTHER_OPEN_SOURCE, License.OTHER_PROPRIETARY]
    >>> bzr.project_reviewed = True
    >>> bzr.license_approved = True
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ValueError: Projects without a license or have 'Other/Proprietary'
    may not be approved.

A project with an Other/Open Source license or additional license info that
is reviewed, but not approved requires a commercial subscription.

    >>> bzr.licenses = [License.OTHER_OPEN_SOURCE]
    >>> bzr.project_reviewed = True
    >>> bzr.qualifies_for_free_hosting
    False

If the licenses or license_info attributes are changed, the
project_reviewed and license_approved attributes are reset to false.

    >>> bzr.license_approved = True
    >>> bzr.project_reviewed = True
    >>> bzr.license_info = 'foo'
    >>> bzr.license_approved
    False
    >>> bzr.project_reviewed
    False

    >>> bzr.license_approved = True
    >>> bzr.project_reviewed = True
    >>> bzr.licenses = [License.BSD]
    >>> bzr.license_approved
    False
    >>> bzr.project_reviewed
    False

When the products license is OTHER_OPEN_SOURCE or the license_info
attribute contains a description of another license, the product
requires approval for free hosting. The qualifies_for_free_hosting
attribute is false for products that have licenses that required
approval, but were not approved.

However, qualifies_for_free_hosting remains true until
it has been reviewed (project_reviewed is set to true). The
OTHER_PROPRIETARY license does not need to be reviewed as do the
OTHER_OPEN_SOURCE license or an unknown license in license_info.

    >>> bzr.license_approved
    False
    >>> bzr.license_info = 'blah'
    >>> bzr.qualifies_for_free_hosting, bzr.commercial_subscription_is_due
    (True, False)

    >>> bzr.project_reviewed = True
    >>> bzr.qualifies_for_free_hosting, bzr.commercial_subscription_is_due
    (False, True)

    >>> bzr.license_info = ''
    >>> bzr.licenses = [License.OTHER_OPEN_SOURCE]
    >>> bzr.qualifies_for_free_hosting, bzr.commercial_subscription_is_due
    (True, False)

    >>> bzr.project_reviewed = True
    >>> bzr.qualifies_for_free_hosting, bzr.commercial_subscription_is_due
    (False, True)

When the license is manually approved, a product qualifies for free
hosting; there is no commercial subscription due.

    >>> bzr.license_approved = True
    >>> bzr.qualifies_for_free_hosting, bzr.commercial_subscription_is_due
    (True, False)

=======================
Product License Reviews
=======================

The forReview() method allows searching for products whose license needs to
be reviewed. You can search by text in the Product table's full text index
as well as the license_info field. The results are ordered by date ceated
then display name.

    >>> from canonical.database.sqlbase import flush_database_updates
    >>> from datetime import timedelta
    >>> bzr.licenses = [License.GNU_GPL_V2, License.ECLIPSE]
    >>> flush_database_updates()
    >>> for product in product_set.forReview(search_text='gnome'):
    ...     print product.displayname
    python gnome2 dev
    Evolution
    GNOME Terminal
    Gnome Applets
    gnomebaker

The license_info field is also serch for matching search_text:

    >>> bzr.license_info = 'Code in /contrib is under a mit-like license.'
    >>> for product in product_set.forReview(search_text='mit'):
    ...     print product.name
    bzr

The whiteboard field is also serch for matching search_text:

    >>> from lp.testing import celebrity_logged_in
    >>> with celebrity_logged_in('registry_experts'):
    ...     bzr.reviewer_whiteboard = (
    ...         'cc-nc discriminates against commercial uses.')
    >>> for product in product_set.forReview(search_text='cc-nc'):
    ...     print product.name
    bzr

You can search for whether the product is active or not.

    >>> for product in product_set.forReview(active=False):
    ...     print product.name
    python-gnome2-dev
    unassigned

You can search for whether the product is marked reviewed or not.

    >>> for product in product_set.forReview(project_reviewed=True):
    ...     print product.name
    python-gnome2-dev
    unassigned
    alsa-utils
    obsolete-junk

You can search for products by license. This will match products with
any one of the licenses listed.

    >>> for product in product_set.forReview(
    ...     licenses=[License.GNU_GPL_V2, License.BSD]):
    ...     print product.name
    bzr
    >>> for product in product_set.forReview(
    ...     licenses=[License.GNU_GPL_V2, License.MIT]):
    ...     print product.name
    bzr

It is possible to search for problem project that have been reviewed, but
not approved

    >>> for product in product_set.forReview(
    ...     project_reviewed=True, license_approved=False):
    ...     print product.name
    python-gnome2-dev
    unassigned
    alsa-utils

You can search for products based on a date range in which the product
was created.

    >>> for product in product_set.forReview(
    ...     search_text='bzr',
    ...     created_after=bzr.datecreated,
    ...     created_before=bzr.datecreated):
    ...     print product.name
    bzr
    >>> for product in product_set.forReview(
    ...     search_text='bzr',
    ...     created_before=bzr.datecreated-timedelta(seconds=1)):
    ...     print product.name

You can search for products based on the expiration date of
its commercial subscription.

    >>> date_expires = bzr.commercial_subscription.date_expires
    >>> for product in product_set.forReview(
    ...     search_text='bzr',
    ...     subscription_expires_after=date_expires,
    ...     subscription_expires_before=date_expires):
    ...     print product.name
    bzr
    >>> for product in product_set.forReview(
    ...     search_text='bzr',
    ...     subscription_expires_after=date_expires+timedelta(seconds=1)):
    ...     print product.name

You can also search using a datetime.date object, since that is what
the web form delivers.

    >>> one_day = timedelta(days=1)
    >>> date_expires = date_expires.date()
    >>> early_date = date(1980, 1, 1)
    >>> late_date = date_expires + timedelta(days=365 * 100)
    >>> for product in product_set.forReview(
    ...     search_text='bzr',
    ...     subscription_expires_after=date_expires,
    ...     subscription_expires_before=date_expires + one_day,
    ...     created_after=early_date,
    ...     created_before=late_date,
    ...     subscription_modified_after=early_date,
    ...     subscription_modified_before=late_date):
    ...     print product.name
    bzr

    >>> for product in product_set.forReview(
    ...     search_text='bzr',
    ...     subscription_expires_after=bzr.datecreated.date(),
    ...     created_before=bzr.datecreated.date() + one_day):
    ...     print product.name
    bzr

You can search for products based on the date of that
its commercial subscription was modified, which only
happens when a voucher is redeemed.

    >>> date_last_modified = bzr.commercial_subscription.date_last_modified
    >>> for product in product_set.forReview(
    ...     search_text='bzr',
    ...     subscription_modified_after=date_last_modified,
    ...     subscription_modified_before=date_last_modified):
    ...     print product.name
    bzr
    >>> for product in product_set.forReview(
    ...     search_text='bzr',
    ...     subscription_modified_after=date_last_modified
    ...                                 +timedelta(seconds=1)):
    ...     print product.name

All the products are returned when no parameters are passed in.

    >>> from lp.registry.model.product import Product
    >>> product_set.forReview().count() == Product.select().count()
    True

The full text search will not match strings with dots in their name
but a clause is included to search specifically for the name.

    >>> new_product = factory.makeProduct(name="abc.com")
    >>> for product in product_set.forReview(search_text="abc.com"):
    ...     print product.name
    abc.com

The use of 'forReview' is limited to users with launchpad.Commercial
permission.

Anonymous users cannot access 'forReview'.

    >>> login(ANONYMOUS)
    >>> check_permission('launchpad.Moderate', product_set)
    False
    >>> gnome = product_set.forReview(search_text='gnome')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    Unauthorized:... 'forReview', 'launchpad.Moderate'...

No Privileges Person cannot access 'forReview'.

    >>> login('no-priv@canonical.com')
    >>> check_permission('launchpad.Moderate', product_set)
    False
    >>> gnome =  product_set.forReview(search_text='gnome')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    Unauthorized:... 'forReview', 'launchpad.Moderate'...

But if we add No Privileges Person to the Registry Experts team he can
access it.

    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')
    >>> registry_member = factory.makePerson()
    >>> registry = celebs.registry_experts
    >>> ignored = registry.addMember(registry_member, registry.teamowner)
