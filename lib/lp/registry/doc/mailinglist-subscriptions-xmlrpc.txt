XMLRPC access to mailing list memberships
=========================================

Just like the creation and deactivation of mailing lists, membership changes
to mailing lists must be communicated to Mailman over XMLRPC.  Because the
bandwidth involved is not expected to be overwhelming, a simplified interface
was chosen.

The communication pattern is initiated by Mailman in all cases; in other
words, Mailman polls Launchpad to see if there is any work for Mailman to do.

    >>> # Note that this test is run multiple times, with the harness
    >>> # providing `mailinglist_api` and `commit` for impedance matching.


Requesting membership information
---------------------------------

Mailman requests membership information for specific list of teams.  Let's
create and populate some teams to demonstrate.

    # login() as an admin so that we can call join() on anyone
    # and change their mailing list auto-subscription settings.
    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')

    >>> from lp.registry.tests.mailinglists_helper import new_team

    >>> team_one, list_one = new_team('team-one', with_list=True)
    >>> anne = factory.makePersonByName('Anne')
    >>> bart = factory.makePersonByName('Bart')
    >>> cris = factory.makePersonByName('Cris')
    >>> dirk = factory.makePersonByName('Dirk')
    >>> elle = factory.makePersonByName('Elle')
    >>> fred = factory.makePersonByName('Fred')
    >>> gwen = factory.makePersonByName('Gwen')
    >>> hank = factory.makePersonByName('Hank')
    >>> people = [anne, bart, cris, dirk, elle, fred, gwen, hank]

    >>> for person in people:
    ...     person.join(team_one)
    ...     list_one.subscribe(person)

    # The IMailingListSet APIs use the SLAVE_FLAVOR since they are read-only.
    # Commit the transaction so that the changes are visible there.
    >>> transaction.commit()

Asking for the membership information for team-one's list returns all the
above people.  We want to see all the email addresses for all the people
subscribed to the mailing list, along with their full name. We'll also print
the address's flags (which will currently always be zero), and the address's
delivery status.  A status of RECIPIENT means the address will receive
messages posted to the list.  A status of X means that delivery to this
address is suppressed.  The important point is that all addresses regardless
of status, will be able to post to the mailing list.

    >>> info = mailinglist_api.getMembershipInformation(('team-one',))
    >>> from lp.registry.tests.mailinglists_helper import print_info
    >>> print_info(info)
    team-one
        anne.person@example.com Anne Person             0 RECIPIENT
        aperson@example.org     Anne Person             0 X
        bart.person@example.com Bart Person             0 RECIPIENT
        bperson@example.org     Bart Person             0 X
        cperson@example.org     Cris Person             0 X
        cris.person@example.com Cris Person             0 RECIPIENT
        dirk.person@example.com Dirk Person             0 RECIPIENT
        dperson@example.org     Dirk Person             0 X
        elle.person@example.com Elle Person             0 RECIPIENT
        eperson@example.org     Elle Person             0 X
        fperson@example.org     Fred Person             0 X
        fred.person@example.com Fred Person             0 RECIPIENT
        gperson@example.org     Gwen Person             0 X
        gwen.person@example.com Gwen Person             0 RECIPIENT
        hank.person@example.com Hank Person             0 RECIPIENT
        hperson@example.org     Hank Person             0 X
        no-priv@canonical.com   No Privileges Person    0 X

We can also ask for the membership information for more than one mailing list
at a time.  Mix things up for the fun of it.

    >>> team_two, list_two = new_team('team-two', with_list=True)
    >>> fred.leave(team_one)
    >>> gwen.leave(team_one)
    >>> for person in people:
    ...     if person is bart:
    ...         continue
    ...     person.join(team_two)
    ...     list_two.subscribe(person)
    >>> transaction.commit()

    >>> info = mailinglist_api.getMembershipInformation(
    ...     ('team-one', 'team-two'))
    >>> print_info(info)
    team-one
        anne.person@example.com Anne Person             0 RECIPIENT
        aperson@example.org     Anne Person             0 X
        bart.person@example.com Bart Person             0 RECIPIENT

        no-priv@canonical.com   No Privileges Person    0 X


Membership tests
----------------

Mailman may also occasionally ask whether a specific email address is
registered with Launchpad.  It does this as a simple line-of-defense against
spam.  Email from addresses not registered with Launchpad are summarily
discarded.

    >>> mailinglist_api.isRegisteredInLaunchpad('dirk.person@example.com')
    True
    >>> mailinglist_api.isRegisteredInLaunchpad('dperson@example.org')
    True
    >>> mailinglist_api.isRegisteredInLaunchpad('geddy.lee@canonical.com')
    False

Similarly, email addresses with an unvalidated status are not considered
registered either.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces.emailaddress import IEmailAddressSet
    >>> emailset = getUtility(IEmailAddressSet)
    >>> new_address = emailset.new(
    ...     'frederick@example.com', fred, account=fred.account)
    >>> new_address.email, new_address.status.title
    (u'frederick@example.com', 'New Email Address')
    >>> sorted((email_address.email, email_address.status.title)
    ...        for email_address in emailset.getByPerson(fred))
    [(u'fperson@example.org', 'Validated Email Address'),
     (u'fred.person@example.com', 'Preferred Email Address'),
     (u'frederick@example.com', 'New Email Address')]
    >>> mailinglist_api.isRegisteredInLaunchpad('frederick@example.com')
    False


Standing tests
--------------

Mailman may also occasionally ask whether a specific email address is a
Launchpad member in good (or better) standing.  It does this when a non-member
of a mailing list tries to post to the mailing list.  By default, an address
not registered in Launchpad is not in good standing (even though the previous
membership test should always take precedence).

    >>> mailinglist_api.inGoodStanding('frederick@example.com')
    False

Since standing makes no sense for teams, an email address assigned to a team
is also not in good standing.

    >>> team_address = list(emailset.getByPerson(team_one))[0]
    >>> mailinglist_api.inGoodStanding(team_address.email)
    False

By default, Launchpad members have an unknown, and thus not good, standing.

    >>> anne.personal_standing
    <DBItem PersonalStanding.UNKNOWN...
    >>> mailinglist_api.inGoodStanding('anne.person@example.com')
    False

Anne is a bad person and the Launchpad administrator assigns her a poor
standing.

    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.person import PersonalStanding
    >>> anne.personal_standing = PersonalStanding.POOR
    >>> transaction.commit()

    >>> mailinglist_api.inGoodStanding('anne.person@example.com')
    False

Anne makes amends and the Launchpad administrator improves her standing.

    >>> anne.personal_standing = PersonalStanding.GOOD
    >>> transaction.commit()

    >>> mailinglist_api.inGoodStanding('anne.person@example.com')
    True

It turns out that Anne is a wonderful person!  Her standing is really
excellent.

    >>> anne.personal_standing = PersonalStanding.EXCELLENT
    >>> transaction.commit()

    >>> mailinglist_api.inGoodStanding('anne.person@example.com')
    True


The archive address
-------------------

We archive messages by sending them to The Mail Archive
<http://www.mail-archive.com>.  They automatically determine which list a
message is posted to so all we need to do is include them in the recipients
list and the rest is taken care of.

    >>> from canonical.config import config
    >>> config.mailman.archive_address
    'archive@mail-archive.dev'

Every public team should have this address as an enabled recipient.  There is
no real name for this member.

    >>> list_one.is_public
    True
    >>> list_two.is_public
    True
    >>> info = mailinglist_api.getMembershipInformation(
    ...     ('team-one', 'team-two'))
    >>> print_info(info, full=True)
    team-one
        anne.person@example.com   Anne Person           0 RECIPIENT
        aperson@example.org       Anne Person           0 X
        archive@mail-archive.dev  (n/a)                 0 RECIPIENT
        bart.person@example.com   Bart Person           0 RECIPIENT
        bperson@example.org       Bart Person           0 X
        cperson@example.org       Cris Person           0 X
        cris.person@example.com   Cris Person           0 RECIPIENT
        dirk.person@example.com   Dirk Person           0 RECIPIENT
        dperson@example.org       Dirk Person           0 X
        elle.person@example.com   Elle Person           0 RECIPIENT
        eperson@example.org       Elle Person           0 X
        hank.person@example.com   Hank Person           0 RECIPIENT
        hperson@example.org       Hank Person           0 X
        no-priv@canonical.com     No Privileges Person  0 X
    team-two
        anne.person@example.com   Anne Person           0 RECIPIENT
        aperson@example.org       Anne Person           0 X
        archive@mail-archive.dev  (n/a)                 0 RECIPIENT
        cperson@example.org       Cris Person           0 X
        cris.person@example.com   Cris Person           0 RECIPIENT
        dirk.person@example.com   Dirk Person           0 RECIPIENT
        dperson@example.org       Dirk Person           0 X
        elle.person@example.com   Elle Person           0 RECIPIENT
        eperson@example.org       Elle Person           0 X
        fperson@example.org       Fred Person           0 X
        fred.person@example.com   Fred Person           0 RECIPIENT
        gperson@example.org       Gwen Person           0 X
        gwen.person@example.com   Gwen Person           0 RECIPIENT
        hank.person@example.com   Hank Person           0 RECIPIENT
        hperson@example.org       Hank Person           0 X
        no-priv@canonical.com     No Privileges Person  0 X

However, in order to prevent this address from being used to forge spam onto
the lists, the archive address is hard-coded to not be registered in
Launchpad.

    >>> mailinglist_api.isRegisteredInLaunchpad(
    ...     config.mailman.archive_address)
    False

This is true even if by dumb luck the address actually gets registered in
Launchpad.

    >>> from canonical.launchpad.interfaces.emailaddress import EmailAddressStatus
    >>> new_address = emailset.new(
    ...     config.mailman.archive_address, fred,
    ...     EmailAddressStatus.VALIDATED, account=fred.account)
    >>> transaction.commit()

    >>> mailinglist_api.isRegisteredInLaunchpad(
    ...     config.mailman.archive_address)
    False

The Mail Archive is only used for public team mailing lists.  If the team
itself is private, so is its archive, and then messages are not sent to the
archiver email address.

    >>> from zope.component import queryAdapter
    >>> from canonical.lazr.interfaces.objectprivacy import IObjectPrivacy
    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.person import PersonVisibility
    >>> team_three = new_team('team-three')
    >>> queryAdapter(team_three, IObjectPrivacy).is_private
    False

Teams with mailing lists cannot change visibility, so the team must be made
private before its mailing list is created.

    >>> team_three.visibility = PersonVisibility.PRIVATE
    >>> queryAdapter(team_three, IObjectPrivacy).is_private
    True

When Anne subscribes to the team-three mailing list, her validated addresses
are the only recipients in the list's membership information.  Because the
team is private, the special archive@mail-archive.dev address is not
included.

    >>> from lp.registry.tests.mailinglists_helper import (
    ...     new_list_for_team)
    >>> list_three = new_list_for_team(team_three)
    >>> list_three.is_public
    False
    >>> anne.join(team_three)
    >>> list_three.subscribe(anne)
    >>> transaction.commit()

    >>> info = mailinglist_api.getMembershipInformation(
    ...     ('team-one', 'team-two', 'team-three'))
    >>> print_info(info, full=True)

Error cases
-----------

If Mailman requests the membership information for a team that doesn't exist,
the team name will have a value of None in the resulting dictionary.

    >>> mailinglist_api.getMembershipInformation(('no-such-team',))
    {'no-such-team': None}
