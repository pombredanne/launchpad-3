DistroSeries
============

From the DerivationOverview spec
<https://launchpad.canonical.com/DerivationOverview>:

    A distribution of GNU/Linux comprises a set of packages, an
    installer, possibly a live-CD, some amount of metadata associated
    with the arrangement of those elements and also a lot of information
    on managing it.

A distro series is a given version of a distribution. So, for Ubuntu, there
are releases (or planned releases) like "warty", "hoary" and "bendy".

Distro releases are retrieved with the IDistroSeriesSet utility, much like
people are retrieved with the IPersonSet utility, or bug tasks are retrieved
with the IBugTaskSet utility.

The IDistroSeriesSet utility is accessed in the usual fashion:


    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from canonical.database.sqlbase import flush_database_updates
    >>> from canonical.launchpad.webapp.testing import verifyObject
    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.distribution import IDistributionSet
    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.distroseries import (
    ...     IDistroSeries,
    ...     IDistroSeriesSet,
    ...     )
    >>> from lp.translations.interfaces.hastranslationimports import (
    ...     IHasTranslationImports)
    >>> distroseriesset = getUtility(IDistroSeriesSet)

To retrieve a specific release of a distribution, use IDistroSeriesSet.get:

    >>> warty = distroseriesset.get(1)
    >>> print warty.name
    warty
    >>> print warty.fullseriesname
    Ubuntu Warty

Or IDistroSeriesSet.findByName:

    >>> for distroseries in distroseriesset.findByName("warty"):
    ...     print distroseries.name
    warty

To get one specific release by name, use queryByName:

    >>> ubuntu = getUtility(IDistributionSet).getByName("ubuntu")

    >>> warty = distroseriesset.queryByName(ubuntu, "warty")
    >>> warty.name
    u'warty'

If the release by that name doesn't exist, None will be returned:

    >>> foobar = distroseriesset.queryByName(ubuntu, "foobar")
    >>> print foobar
    None

Or IDistroSeriesSet.findByVersion:

    >>> for distroseries in distroseriesset.findByVersion("5.04"):
    ...     print distroseries.name
    hoary

We verify that a distroseries does in fact fully provide IDistroSeries:

    >>> verifyObject(IDistroSeries, warty)
    True
    >>> IDistroSeries.providedBy(warty)
    True

And IHasTranslationImports:

    >>> verifyObject(IHasTranslationImports, warty)
    True
    >>> IHasTranslationImports.providedBy(warty)
    True

To search the set of IDistroSeriess, use IDistroSeriesSet.search:

    >>> ubuntu_releases = distroseriesset.search(
    ...     distribution=ubuntu, isreleased=True, orderBy="-datereleased")
    >>> [release.name for release in ubuntu_releases]
    [u'warty']

    >>> all_ubuntu_releases = distroseriesset.search(distribution=ubuntu)
    >>> all_ubuntu_releases.count()
    4


Distroseries identifying attributes
-----------------------------------

A distroseries has a set of attributes that identify it. The launchpad id is
the name attribute.

    >>> print warty.name
    warty

It has a title for heading and titles...

    >>> print warty.title
    The Warty Warthog Release

And a displayname for referring to it in a sentence.

    >>> print warty.displayname
    Warty

The fullseriesname attribute is used when the context of the series name
can be confused. Note that the value is created from the launchpad id names
of the distribution and the series, though it may look like the displayname
attributes were used.

    >>> print warty.fullseriesname
    Ubuntu Warty

The version attribute holds the debversion of the series.

    >>> print warty.version
    4.10

The named_version attribute is used is used to present the series displayname
and version values consistently.

    >>> print warty.named_version
    Warty (4.10)


Published sources
-----------------

DistroSeries.getPublishedSources:

    >>> from lp.registry.model.distroseries import DistroSeries
    >>> from lp.registry.model.sourcepackagename import SourcePackageName
    >>> warty2 = DistroSeries.get(1)

Passing a ISourcePackageName as argument:

    >>> prs = warty2.getPublishedSources(
    ...       SourcePackageName.byName('mozilla-firefox'))
    >>> print prs.count()
    1
    >>> print prs[0].sourcepackagerelease.sourcepackagename.name
    mozilla-firefox

Passing a string name:

    >>> print warty2.getPublishedSources('mozilla-firefox').count()
    1

Including pending publication records in the result:

    >>> print warty2.getPublishedSources('mozilla-firefox',
    ...           include_pending=True).count()
    2

Not found as empty list:

    >>> print warty2.getPublishedSources('nosuchpackage').count()
    0

See distroseries-publishing-lookups.txt for more information.

canUploadToPocket method helps us to decide if an upload is allowed or
not, according the distroseries status and the upload target pocket.

    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.distribution import IDistributionSet
    >>> ubuntu = getUtility(IDistributionSet)['ubuntu']
    >>> breezy_autotest = ubuntu['breezy-autotest']
    >>> hoary = ubuntu['hoary']

    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.pocket import PackagePublishingPocket
    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.series import SeriesStatus

    >>> warty.status.name
    'CURRENT'
    >>> warty.canUploadToPocket(PackagePublishingPocket.RELEASE)
    False
    >>> warty.canUploadToPocket(PackagePublishingPocket.SECURITY)
    True

    >>> breezy_autotest.status.name
    'EXPERIMENTAL'
    >>> breezy_autotest.canUploadToPocket(PackagePublishingPocket.RELEASE)
    True
    >>> breezy_autotest.canUploadToPocket(PackagePublishingPocket.SECURITY)
    False

The FROZEN status is special.  Uploads are allowed for all pockets as
the upload will have to wait for manual approval anyway:

    >>> from zope.security.proxy import removeSecurityProxy
    >>> removeSecurityProxy(hoary).status = SeriesStatus.FROZEN

    >>> hoary.status.name
    'FROZEN'
    >>> hoary.canUploadToPocket(PackagePublishingPocket.RELEASE)
    True
    >>> hoary.canUploadToPocket(PackagePublishingPocket.SECURITY)
    True


Package searching
-----------------

You can search through binary packages publishing in a distribution
release by using the searchPackages method, which uses magical fti:

    >>> warty.searchPackages("pmount").count()
    1

This also works for small or weirdly named packages that don't work
through fti, and even for substrings:

    >>> warty.searchPackages("linux-2.6.12").count()
    1
    >>> warty.searchPackages("at").count()
    1
    >>> pkgs = warty.searchPackages('a')
    >>> for dsbp in pkgs:
    ...     print "%s: %s" % (dsbp.__class__.__name__, dsbp.name)
    DistroSeriesBinaryPackage: foobar
    DistroSeriesBinaryPackage: mozilla-firefox
    DistroSeriesBinaryPackage: at


DistroSeriess have components and sections
------------------------------------------

A distroseries has some number of components and/or sections which
are valid for that distroseries. These selections are used by (among
other things) the uploader for validating incoming uploads.

    >>> hoary = distroseriesset.get(3)
    >>> for c in hoary.components:
    ...     print c.name
    main
    restricted
    >>> for s in hoary.sections:
    ...     print s.name
    base
    web
    editors
    admin
    devel
    translations

    >>> from lp.soyuz.interfaces.component import IComponentSet
    >>> from lp.soyuz.interfaces.section import ISectionSet
    >>> python = getUtility(ISectionSet).ensure('python')

    >>> hoary.addSection(python)

    >>> for c in hoary.components:
    ...     print c.name
    main
    restricted

    >>> for s in hoary.sections:
    ...     print s.name
    base
    web
    editors
    admin
    devel
    python
    translations

Breezy-autotest has got a partner component, which is not reported:

    >>> breezyautotest = distroseriesset.queryByName(
    ...     ubuntu, "breezy-autotest")
    >>> for c in breezyautotest.components:
    ...     print c.name
    main
    restricted
    universe
    multiverse

The upload_components property, however, reports all the available
components since partner is allowed for upload:

    >>> for c in breezyautotest.upload_components:
    ...     print c.name
    main
    restricted
    universe
    multiverse
    partner


DistroSeries can be initialized from their parents
--------------------------------------------------

When a distroseries is derived from another distroseries (be it a
derivative distribution, or simply the next release in a sequence from
Ubuntu) we need to initialize the new release with quite a lot of
information. Not least of which is the section and component
selections and the publishing information for the distroseries.

DistroSeries provides us with a method for doing this which carefully
goes behind the back of sqlobject to copy potentially tens of
thousands of rows around in order to set up a distroseries.

IDistroSeries lists a series of preconditions for performing an
initialization. In particular the initializer won't overwrite
publishing records etc. Essentially this is a "Do not push this button
again" type set of assertions.

    >>> from lp.soyuz.scripts.initialize_distroseries import (
    ...     InitializeDistroSeries)
    >>> login("foo.bar@canonical.com")
    >>> humpy = ubuntu.newSeries('humpy', 'Humpy Hippo',
    ...                          'The Humpy Hippo', 'Fat', 'Yo Momma',
    ...                          '99.2', None, hoary.owner)
    >>> humpy.previous_series = hoary
    >>> ids = InitializeDistroSeries(humpy, [hoary.id])
    >>> ids.initialize()
    >>> hoary.getPublishedSources('pmount').count()
    1
    >>> humpy.getPublishedSources('pmount').count()
    1
    >>> len(hoary['i386'].getReleasedPackages('pmount'))
    1
    >>> len(humpy['i386'].getReleasedPackages('pmount'))
    1

Check if the attributes of an DRSPR instance for the just initialized
distroseries are sane. A DRSPR instance should filter attributes of
a SPR according the distroseries in question (practically according
what is published in this distrorelelase)

Since the initialize-from-parent procedure copies the latest
publications from the parent IDRSPR.builds should be empty, reflecting
that there are no builds for this SPR in this DistroSeries.
IDRSPR.builds will be non-empty after a developer submits a new SPR
for the  DistroSeries.

In other hand IDRSPR.binaries should return the binaries resulted of
the SPRs inheritance by joining BPP->BPR->BUILD->SPR, i.e, binaries
published in this distroseries (in fact, in one of its architectures)
resulted of the sourcepackagerelease in question, but built anywhere.
(fix bug #52938)

Initialize a new distroseries based on warty (since it has, at least
one coherent published source + binary, mozilla-firefox)

    >>> bumpy = ubuntu.newSeries('bumpy', 'Bumpy',
    ...                          'The Bumpy', 'Fat', 'Boom',
    ...                          '99.3', None, warty.owner)
    >>> bumpy.previous_series = warty
    >>> ids = InitializeDistroSeries(bumpy, [warty.id])
    >>> ids.initialize()

Build a new ISourcePackage based in the new distroseries:

    >>> bumpy_firefox_sp = bumpy.getSourcePackage('mozilla-firefox')

Check the content IDRSPR binaries & builds attributes:

'binaries' should be inherited from parent release.

    >>> bumpy_firefox_sp.currentrelease.binaries.count()
    3

    >>> for bin in bumpy_firefox_sp.currentrelease.binaries:
    ...     print bin.id, bin.title, bin.build.distro_arch_series.title
    27 mozilla-firefox-data-0.9 The Warty Warthog Release for i386 (x86)
    26 mozilla-firefox-0.9 The Warty Warthog Release for hppa (hppa)
    12 mozilla-firefox-0.9 The Warty Warthog Release for i386 (x86)


'builds' should be empty since it was built in parent (warty), not in this
distroseries (bumby.

    >>> len(bumpy_firefox_sp.currentrelease.builds)
    0

the SPR returns all build records for it.

    >>> bumpy_firefox_sp.currentrelease.sourcepackagerelease.builds.count()
    4

The new series also has the same packaging links as its parent series.

    >>> for packaging in warty.packagings:
    ...     print packaging.sourcepackagename.name
    a52dec
    alsa-utils
    evolution
    mozilla-firefox
    netapplet

    >>> for packaging in bumpy.packagings:
    ...     print packaging.sourcepackagename.name
    a52dec
    alsa-utils
    evolution
    mozilla-firefox
    netapplet


Translatable Packages and Packaging
-----------------------------------

You can easily find out what packages are translatable in a
distribution release:

    >>> translatables = hoary.getTranslatableSourcePackages()
    >>> for translatable in translatables:
    ...    print translatable.name
    evolution
    mozilla
    pmount

Packages can be linked to upstream productseries in specific
distribution releases. IDistroSeries offers a way to query translatable
packages that are linked to upstream productseries.

    >>> unlinked_translatables = hoary.getUnlinkedTranslatableSourcePackages()
    >>> for translatable in unlinked_translatables:
    ...    print translatable.name
    pmount
    mozilla

The links to upstream product series can be verified using the
packagings property:

    >>> packagings = hoary.packagings
    >>> for packaging in packagings:
    ...     print packaging.sourcepackagename.name, \
    ...           packaging.productseries.product.displayname
    evolution Evolution
    mozilla-firefox Mozilla Firefox
    netapplet NetApplet

From the results above you can notice that neither mozilla-firefox nor
netapplet are translatable in Hoary.


Packages that need linking and packagings that need upstream information
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The distroseries getPrioritizedUnlinkedSourcePackages() method returns
a prioritized list of `ISourcePackage` objects that need a packaging link to
an `IProductSeries` to provide the the upstream information to share bugs,
translations, and code. Each item in the list is a dict with the 'package',
total_bugs, and total_messages (translatable messages).

    >>> for summary in hoary.getPrioritizedUnlinkedSourcePackages():
    ...     print  summary['package'].name
    ...     print '%(bug_count)s %(total_messages)s' % summary
    pmount  0  64
    alsa-utils  0  0
    cnews  0  0
    libstdc++  0  0
    linux-source-2.6.15  0  0


The distroseries getPrioritizedPackagings() method that returns a prioritized
list of `IPackaging` that need more information about the upstream project to
share bugs, translations, and code.

    >>> for packaging in hoary.getPrioritizedPackagings():
    ...     print packaging.sourcepackagename.name
    netapplet
    evolution


Most recently linked packagings
-------------------------------

The distroseries getMostRecentlyLinkedPackagings() method returns a
list of up to five packages that are the most recently linked to an
upstream.

    >>> distribution = factory.makeDistribution()
    >>> distroseries = factory.makeDistroSeries(distribution=distribution)
    >>> pkgs = distroseries.getMostRecentlyLinkedPackagings()
    >>> print pkgs.count()
    0

    >>> for name in ['aaron', 'bjorn', 'chex', 'deryck', 'edwin', 'francis']:
    ...     product = factory.makeProduct(name=name)
    ...     productseries = factory.makeProductSeries(product=product)
    ...     spn = factory.makeSourcePackageName(name=name)
    ...     package = factory.makeSourcePackage(sourcepackagename=spn,
    ...                                         distroseries=distroseries)
    ...     package.setPackaging(productseries, product.owner)
    ...     transaction.commit()


    >>> pkgs = distroseries.getMostRecentlyLinkedPackagings()
    >>> for packaging in pkgs:
    ...     print packaging.sourcepackagename.name
    francis
    edwin
    deryck
    chex
    bjorn

DistroSeries can build meta objects for packages
------------------------------------------------

    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.sourcepackage import ISourcePackage
    >>> from lp.soyuz.interfaces.distroseriesbinarypackage import IDistroSeriesBinaryPackage
    >>> from lp.soyuz.interfaces.distroseriessourcepackagerelease import IDistroSeriesSourcePackageRelease

    >>> pmount_src_name = SourcePackageName.byName('pmount')
    >>> pmount_source = hoary.getSourcePackage(pmount_src_name)
    >>> ISourcePackage.providedBy(pmount_source)
    True

    >>> from lp.soyuz.model.binarypackagename import (
    ...                                       BinaryPackageName)
    >>> pmount_bin_name = BinaryPackageName.byName('pmount')
    >>> pmount_drbp = hoary.getBinaryPackage(pmount_bin_name)
    >>> IDistroSeriesBinaryPackage.providedBy(pmount_drbp)
    True
    >>> len(pmount_drbp.current_publishings)
    3

    >>> from lp.soyuz.model.sourcepackagerelease import (
    ...                                           SourcePackageRelease)
    >>> pmount_rel = SourcePackageRelease.selectOneBy(
    ...     sourcepackagenameID=pmount_src_name.id, version='0.1-1')
    >>> pmount_rel.sourcepackagename.name
    u'pmount'

    >>> pmount_srcrel = hoary.getSourcePackageRelease(pmount_rel)
    >>> IDistroSeriesSourcePackageRelease.providedBy(pmount_srcrel)
    True

Check some properties of DRSPR meta class

Entire publishing history:

    >>> pmount_srcrel.publishing_history.count()
    1

Most recent published history row:

    >>> pmount_srcrel.current_published is None
    True

    >>> netapplet_srcrel =  hoary.getSourcePackage('netapplet').currentrelease
    >>> spph = netapplet_srcrel.current_published

    >>> spph.section.name
    u'web'

The changesfile attribute contains the package changelog. It is provided as
an ILibraryFileAlias:

    >>> firefox_srcrel =  warty.getSourcePackage(
    ...    'mozilla-firefox').currentrelease
    >>> print firefox_srcrel.title
    "mozilla-firefox" 0.9 source package in The Warty Warthog Release

    >>> firefox_srcrel.changesfile
    <LibraryFileAlias at ...>

If the package changelog is not available, that attribute is None:

    >>> netapplet_srcrel.changesfile is None
    True

Perform `post publication` override:

    >>> new_section = getUtility(ISectionSet)['base']

    >>> override = netapplet_srcrel.current_published.changeOverride(
    ...     new_section=new_section)

    >>> override.section == new_section
    True

    >>> print override.status.name
    PENDING

    >>> netapplet_srcrel.publishing_history.count()
    2

Override information about 'pmount' is pending publication:

    >>> print netapplet_srcrel.current_published.status.name
    PENDING

    >>> print netapplet_srcrel.current_published.section.name
    base

Supersede previous netapplet publication:

    >>> last_published = netapplet_srcrel.publishing_history[1]
    >>> last_published.supersede()
    >>> flush_database_updates()

    >>> netapplet_srcrel.publishing_history.count()
    2

    >>> print last_published.status.name
    SUPERSEDED

    >>> from canonical.database.sqlbase import get_transaction_timestamp
    >>> last_published.datesuperseded == get_transaction_timestamp()
    True


SourcePackagePublishingHistory
------------------------------

IDistroSeries.getSourcePackagePublishing returns all the ISPPH
records for a given status in a given pocket. It makes easy to
generate a list of currently published sources for override-check, for
instance. it can also be used to generate the archive packages list in
the future.

    >>> ubuntu = getUtility(IDistributionSet)['ubuntu']
    >>> hoary = ubuntu['hoary']

    >>> from lp.soyuz.enums import PackagePublishingStatus
    >>> hoary_pub_sources = hoary.getSourcePackagePublishing(
    ...     PackagePublishingStatus.PUBLISHED,
    ...     PackagePublishingPocket.RELEASE)

    >>> hoary_pub_sources.count()
    6

    >>> for pub in hoary_pub_sources:
    ...     print pub.displayname
    alsa-utils 1.0.9a-4ubuntu1 in hoary
    cnews cr.g7-37 in hoary
    evolution 1.0 in hoary
    libstdc++ b8p in hoary
    linux-source-2.6.15 2.6.15.3 in hoary
    pmount 0.1-2 in hoary

    >>> hoary_pub_source = hoary_pub_sources[0]

    >>> hoary_pub_source.sourcepackagerelease.name
    u'alsa-utils'

    >>> hoary_pub_source.sourcepackagerelease.version
    u'1.0.9a-4ubuntu1'

    >>> hoary_pub_source.component.name
    u'main'

    >>> hoary_pub_source.section.name
    u'base'

    >>> hoary.getSourcePackagePublishing(
    ...     PackagePublishingStatus.PUBLISHED,
    ...     PackagePublishingPocket.UPDATES).count()
    0

This method also allow us to restrict the results to a given
component:

    >>> component_main = getUtility(IComponentSet)['main']
    >>> hoary.getSourcePackagePublishing(
    ...     PackagePublishingStatus.PUBLISHED,
    ...     PackagePublishingPocket.RELEASE,
    ...     component=component_main).count()
    5

    >>> component_multiverse = getUtility(IComponentSet)['multiverse']
    >>> hoary.getSourcePackagePublishing(
    ...     PackagePublishingStatus.PUBLISHED,
    ...     PackagePublishingPocket.RELEASE,
    ...     component=component_multiverse).count()
    0

By default the IDistribution 'main_archive' is considered, but It also
allows the callsite to specify one and then the result will be
restricted to it.

    >>> debian_archive = getUtility(IDistributionSet)['debian'].main_archive
    >>> print debian_archive.purpose.title
    Primary Archive

    >>> hoary.getSourcePackagePublishing(
    ...     PackagePublishingStatus.PUBLISHED,
    ...     PackagePublishingPocket.RELEASE,
    ...     component=component_main, archive=debian_archive).count()
    0

ISPP.getPublishedBinaries returns all the binaries generated by the
publication in question:

    >>> warty = ubuntu['warty']
    >>> warty_pub_sources = warty.getSourcePackagePublishing(
    ...     PackagePublishingStatus.PUBLISHED,
    ...     PackagePublishingPocket.RELEASE)

    >>> warty_pub_source = warty_pub_sources[4]
    >>> warty_pub_source.sourcepackagerelease.name
    u'mozilla-firefox'
    >>> warty_pub_source.sourcepackagerelease.version
    u'0.9'
    >>> warty_pub_source.component.name
    u'main'
    >>> warty_pub_source.section.name
    u'web'

    >>> warty_mozilla_pub_binaries = warty_pub_source.getPublishedBinaries()
    >>> len(warty_mozilla_pub_binaries)
    4
    >>> warty_mozilla_pub_bin = warty_mozilla_pub_binaries[0]

    >>> from lp.soyuz.interfaces.publishing import IBinaryPackagePublishingHistory
    >>> verifyObject(IBinaryPackagePublishingHistory, warty_mozilla_pub_bin)
    True

    >>> warty_mozilla_pub_bin.binarypackagerelease.name
    u'mozilla-firefox'
    >>> warty_mozilla_pub_bin.binarypackagerelease.version
    u'0.9'
    >>> warty_mozilla_pub_bin.component.name
    u'main'
    >>> warty_mozilla_pub_bin.section.name
    u'base'

DistroSeries.getBinaryPackagePublishing will return
BinaryPackagePublishingHistory objects for the DistroSeries:

    >>> warty = ubuntu['warty']
    >>> bpphs = warty.getBinaryPackagePublishing()
    >>> bpphs.count()
    10
    >>> 'mozilla-firefox' in set(
    ...     pkgpub.binarypackagerelease.binarypackagename.name
    ...     for pkgpub in bpphs)
    True

It also allows us to pass wanted strings like: name, version, archtag and
sourcename.

    >>> warty.getBinaryPackagePublishing(
    ...     name="nosuchpackage").count()
    0
    >>> warty.getBinaryPackagePublishing(
    ...     version="nosuchversion").count()
    0
    >>> warty.getBinaryPackagePublishing(
    ...     archtag="nosucharch").count()
    0
    >>> warty.getBinaryPackagePublishing(
    ...     sourcename="nosuchsource").count()
    0

We can restrict the results by component:

    >>> warty.getBinaryPackagePublishing(
    ...     component=component_main).count()
    10
    >>> warty.getBinaryPackagePublishing(
    ...     component=component_multiverse).count()
    0

By pocket:

    >>> warty.getBinaryPackagePublishing(
    ...     pocket=PackagePublishingPocket.RELEASE).count()
    10
    >>> warty.getBinaryPackagePublishing(
    ...     pocket=PackagePublishingPocket.BACKPORTS).count()
    0

Or any combination of them:

    >>> warty.getBinaryPackagePublishing(
    ...     sourcename="alsa", pocket=PackagePublishingPocket.RELEASE,
    ...     component=component_main).count()
    0

    >>> warty.getBinaryPackagePublishing(
    ...     name="mozilla-firefox", archtag='i386',
    ...     component=component_main).count()
    2

As getSourcePackagePublishing, getBinaryPublishing accepts 'archive'
parameter for result restriction:

    >>> warty.getBinaryPackagePublishing(
    ...     name="mozilla-firefox", archtag='i386',
    ...     component=component_main, archive=debian_archive).count()
    0

getAllPublishedSources will return all publications with status PUBLISHED
and in the main archives for this distroseries:

    >>> sources = warty.getAllPublishedSources()
    >>> for source in sources:
    ...     print(
    ...         source.sourcepackagerelease.sourcepackagename.name,
    ...         source.sourcepackagerelease.version)
    (u'netapplet', u'0.99.6-1')
    (u'alsa-utils', u'1.0.8-1ubuntu1')
    (u'alsa-utils', u'1.0.9a-4')
    (u'mozilla-firefox', u'0.9')
    (u'cdrkit', u'1.0')
    (u'iceweasel', u'1.0')

Similarly for binary publications:

    >>> binaries = warty.getAllPublishedBinaries()
    >>> for binary in binaries:
    ...     print(
    ...         binary.binarypackagerelease.binarypackagename.name,
    ...         binary.binarypackagerelease.version)
    (u'mozilla-firefox', u'0.9')
    (u'pmount', u'0.1-1')
    (u'linux-2.6.12', u'2.6.12.20')
    (u'pmount', u'2:1.9-1')
    (u'at', u'3.14156')
    (u'cdrkit', u'1.0')
    (u'mozilla-firefox', u'1.0')
    (u'mozilla-firefox', u'0.9')
    (u'mozilla-firefox-data', u'0.9')
    (u'mozilla-firefox-data', u'0.9')


Creating DistroSeries
---------------------

Users with launchpad.Driver permission may create DistroSeries. In the
case of an `IDerivativeDistribution` A user who is a driver can create
the series and he is automatically assigned to the series' driver role
so that he can edit it.

    >>> youbuntu = factory.makeDistribution(name='youbuntu')
    >>> yo_driver = factory.makePerson(name='yo-driver')
    >>> youbuntu.driver = yo_driver
    >>> login_person(yo_driver)
    >>> youbuntu.full_functionality
    False

    >>> yo_series = youbuntu.newSeries(
    ...     name='island', displayname='Island', title='YouBuntu Island',
    ...     summary='summary', description='description', version='09.07',
    ...     previous_series=warty, registrant=yo_driver)
    >>> print yo_series.name
    island
    >>> print yo_series.registrant.name
    yo-driver
    >>> print yo_series.driver.name
    yo-driver

Owners of derivative distributions, and admins can create series too, but
they are not automatically set as the series driver because they always
have permission to edit the series.

    >>> login_person(youbuntu.owner)
    >>> yo_series = youbuntu.newSeries(
    ...     name='forest', displayname='Forest', title='YouBuntu Forest',
    ...     summary='summary', description='description', version='09.07',
    ...     previous_series=warty, registrant=youbuntu.owner)
    >>> print yo_series.name
    forest
    >>> print yo_series.driver
    None

Ubuntu is an `IBaseDistribution` which requires special preparation for
Soyuz and Translations before a series can be created. Ubuntu driver can
not create series.

    >>> login_person(ubuntu.owner.activemembers[0])
    >>> ubuntu.driver = yo_driver
    >>> login_person(yo_driver)
    >>> ubuntu.newSeries(
    ...     name='finch', displayname='Finch', title='Ubuntu Finch',
    ...     summary='summary', description='description', version='9.06',
    ...     previous_series=warty, owner=ubuntu.driver)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
     ...
    Unauthorized: ...

Owners and admins of base distributions are the only users who can create a
series.

    >>> login_person(ubuntu.owner.activemembers[0])
    >>> u_series = ubuntu.newSeries(
    ...     name='finch', displayname='Finch', title='Ubuntu Finch',
    ...     summary='summary', description='description', version='9.06',
    ...     previous_series=warty, registrant=ubuntu.owner)
    >>> print u_series.name
    finch
    >>> print u_series.registrant.name
    ubuntu-team
    >>> print u_series.driver
    None


Specification Listings
----------------------

We should be able to get lists of specifications in different states
related to a distroseries.

Basically, we can filter by completeness, and by whether or not the spec is
informational.

    >>> distroset = getUtility(IDistributionSet)
    >>> kubuntu = distroset.getByName("kubuntu")
    >>> krunch = kubuntu.getSeries("krunch")
    >>> from lp.blueprints.enums import SpecificationFilter

First, there should be one informational specs for krunch:

    >>> filter = [SpecificationFilter.INFORMATIONAL]
    >>> krunch.specifications(filter=filter).count()
    1


There are 2 completed specs for Krunch:

    >>> filter = [SpecificationFilter.COMPLETE]
    >>> for spec in kubuntu.specifications(filter=filter):
    ...    print spec.name, spec.is_complete
    thinclient-local-devices True
    usplash-on-hibernation True


And there are 2 incomplete specs:

    >>> filter = [SpecificationFilter.INCOMPLETE]
    >>> for spec in krunch.specifications(filter=filter):
    ...     print spec.name, spec.is_complete
    cluster-installation False
    revu False


If we ask for all specs, we get them in the order of priority.

    >>> filter = [SpecificationFilter.ALL]
    >>> for spec in krunch.specifications(filter=filter):
    ...    print spec.priority.title, spec.name
    Essential cluster-installation
    High revu
    Medium thinclient-local-devices
    Low usplash-on-hibernation
    Undefined kde-desktopfile-langpacks
    Not krunch-desktop-plan


With a distroseries, we can ask for ACCEPTED, PROPOSED and DECLINED specs:

    >>> filter=[SpecificationFilter.ACCEPTED]
    >>> for spec in krunch.specifications(filter=filter):
    ...     print spec.name, spec.goalstatus.title
    cluster-installation Accepted
    revu Accepted
    thinclient-local-devices Accepted
    usplash-on-hibernation Accepted

    >>> filter=[SpecificationFilter.PROPOSED]
    >>> for spec in krunch.specifications(filter=filter):
    ...     print spec.name, spec.goalstatus.title
    kde-desktopfile-langpacks Proposed

    >>> filter=[SpecificationFilter.DECLINED]
    >>> for spec in krunch.specifications(filter=filter):
    ...     print spec.name, spec.goalstatus.title
    krunch-desktop-plan Declined


And if we ask just for specs, we get BOTH the incomplete and the complete
ones that have been accepted.

    >>> for spec in krunch.specifications():
    ...     print spec.name, spec.is_complete, spec.goalstatus.title
    cluster-installation False Accepted
    revu False Accepted
    thinclient-local-devices True Accepted
    usplash-on-hibernation True Accepted

We can filter for specifications that contain specific text:

    >>> for spec in krunch.specifications(filter=['usb']):
    ...     print spec.name
    thinclient-local-devices


Drivers
=======

Distributions have drivers, who are people that have permission to approve
bugs and features for specific releases. The rules are that:

 1. a "driver" can be set on either Distribution or DistroSeries
 2. drivers are only actually relevant on a DistroSeries, because thats the
    granularity at which we track spec/bug targeting
 3. the important attribute is ".drivers" on a distroseries, it is
    calculated based on the combination of owners and drivers in the
    distribution and the distroseries. It is a LIST of drivers, which might
    be empty, or have one or two people/teams in it.
 4. If the release has a driver, then that driver is in the list.
 5. If the distribution has a driver then that is in the list too, otherwise
 6. If neither the release nor the distribution has a driver, then the
    distribution registrant is the driver.

We test these rules below.


First, we look at a release where both the distribution and release have
drivers. Kubuntu should be a good example.

    >>> kubuntu.driver.name
    u'jblack'
    >>> krunch.driver.name
    u'edgar'
    >>> for d in krunch.drivers:
    ...     print d.name
    edgar
    jblack


Now, we look at a release where there is a driver on the release but not on
the distribution.

    >>> debian = distroset.getByName('debian')
    >>> print debian.driver
    None
    >>> print debian.owner.name
    mark
    >>> sarge = debian.getSeries('sarge')
    >>> print sarge.driver.name
    jdub
    >>> for d in sarge.drivers:
    ...     print d.name
    jdub
    mark


Now, a release where there is no driver on the release but there is a driver
on the distribution.

    >>> redhat = distroset.getByName('redhat')
    >>> print redhat.driver.name
    jblack
    >>> six = redhat.getSeries('six')
    >>> print six.driver
    None
    >>> for d in six.drivers:
    ...     print d.name
    jblack

Finally, on a release where neither the distribution nor the release have a
driver. Here, we expect the driver to be the owner of the distribution
(because this is the "commonest fallback").

    >>> sid = debian.getSeries('sid')
    >>> print debian.driver
    None
    >>> print debian.owner.name
    mark
    >>> print sid.driver
    None
    >>> print sid.registrant.name
    jdub

    >>> for d in sid.drivers:
    ...     print d.name
    mark


Lastest Uploads
---------------

IDistroSeries provides the 'getLatestUpload' method which returns a
list of the last 5 (five) IDistroSeriesSourcePackageRelease (IDRSPR)
uploaded and published in its context.

    >>> warty = ubuntu['warty']
    >>> latest_uploads = warty.getLatestUploads()

Each element is an IDistroSeriesSourcePackageRelease instance:

    >>> for upload in latest_uploads:
    ...     print upload.title
    "mozilla-firefox" 0.9 source package in The Warty Warthog Release

Also, empty results (caused obviously by lack of sample data or very
earlier development state of a distroseries) are possible:

    >>> ubuntutest = getUtility(IDistributionSet)['ubuntutest']
    >>> breezy_autotest = ubuntutest['breezy-autotest']
    >>> latest_uploads = breezy_autotest.getLatestUploads()

    >>> len(latest_uploads)
    0


Getting build records for a distro series
-----------------------------------------

IDistroSeries inherits the IHasBuildRecords interfaces and therefore provides
a getBuildRecords() method.

    >>> builds = ubuntu['warty'].getBuildRecords(name='firefox')
    >>> for build in builds:
    ...     print build.title
    hppa build of mozilla-firefox 0.9 in ubuntu warty RELEASE
    i386 build of mozilla-firefox 0.9 in ubuntu warty RELEASE

For further options that can be used with getBuildRecords(), please
see hasbuildrecords.txt
