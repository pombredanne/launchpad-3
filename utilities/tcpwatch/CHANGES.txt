Next release

  - Added support for HTTP CONNECT, allowing tcpwatch to work as an
    HTTPS proxy.

  - Write log files in binary mode, which is important for Windows.


Version 1.3

  - Made compatible with versions of tcl that have threads enabled.

  - Log file numbers are now sequential.

  - "user@host" is now accepted as a destination hostname (the user
    name is ignored).


Version 1.2.1

  - A typo made it impossible to use two of the command line options.
    Fixed.


Version 1.2

  - Added the ability to record TCP sessions to a directory.
    Use -r <path>.  Implemented by Tres Seaver.

  - Replaced the launch script with a distutils setup.py, thanks again
    to Tres Seaver.


Version 1.1

  - Almost completely rewritten.  The code is now more reusable and
    reliable, but the user interface has not changed much.

  - 8-bit clean.  (You can now use TCPWatch to verify that SSH really
    does encrypt data. ;-) )

  - It can now run as a simple HTTP proxy server using the "-p"
    option.  There are a lot of interesting ways to use this.

  - It's now easier to watch persistent HTTP connections.  The "-h"
    option shows each transaction in a separate entry.

  - You can turn off the Tkinter GUI using the -s option, which
    outputs to stdout.

  - Colorized Tkinter output.


Version 1.0

  Never released to the public.
